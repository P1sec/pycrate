3	Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
Elementary Procedure: SLmAP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between LMUs in the E-UTRAN and E-SMLCs in the EPC. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as standalone procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of several SLmAP EPs together or together with EPs from other interfaces is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g., TS 23.305 [2]).
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
-	On time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
-	One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined for successful outcome.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.

3.3	Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].

4	General
4.1	Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see clause 10.
4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g., E-RAB procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g., MESSAGE NAME message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g., Information Element IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in subclause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g., "Value".
5	SLmAP Services
SLmAP provides the signalling service between E-SMLC and the Location Measurement Unit (LMU) that is required to fulfil the SLmAP functions described in clause 7. The procedures are divided into two groups:
1.	UTDOA Measurement Information Transfer procedures;
2.	SLm Interface Management procedures.
6	Services Expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of SLmAP messages. SLmAP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
7	Functions of SLmAP
The SLmAP protocol has the following functions:
-	Measurement Information Transfer. This function allows the E-SMLC to exchange measurement information with the LMU for the purpose of UTDOA positioning.
-	SLm interface management.  This function allows initialization of the SLm interface and exchange of capability information between the E-SMLC and LMU.
-	Reporting of general error situations.  This function allows proper error reporting and handling.

8.2	Measurement Procedures
8.2.1	Measurement
8.2.1.1	General
The purpose of the Measurement procedure is to allow the E-SMLC to request the LMU to perform and report UL RTOA measurements for the purpose of UTDOA positioning.
8.2.1.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.2.1: Measurement procedure. Successful operation.
The E-SMLC initiates the procedure by sending a MEASUREMENT REQUEST message to the LMU. The E-SMLC shall include the deltaSS IE in the MEASUREMENT REQUEST message if SRS sequence hopping is enabled for that particular measurement. If the deltaSS IE is included in the MEASUREMENT REQUEST message, the LMU shall consider that SRS sequence hopping is enabled for the measurement being requested. If the requested measurement has been successful, the LMU shall reply with a MEASUREMENT RESPONSE message.
8.2.1.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.3.1: Measurement procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the LMU cannot successfully measure the UL RTOA for the target UE, it shall respond with a MEASUREMENT FAILURE message indicating the cause of the failure.
8.2.1.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.2.2	Measurement Update
8.2.2.1	General
The purpose of the Measurement Update Procedure is to notify the LMU of a change in the previously signalled measurement configuration for one or more cells for the UE being positioned.
8.2.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2.2.1: Measurement Update: Successful Operation.
The E-SMLC initiates the procedure by sending a MEASUREMENT UPDATE message. The E-SMLC shall include the deltaSS IE in the MEASUREMENT UPDATE message if SRS sequence hopping is enabled for that particular measurement. If the deltaSS IE is included in the MEASUREMENT UPDATE message, the LMU shall consider that SRS sequence hopping is enabled for the measurement.
Upon receiving the UL RTOA Measurement Configuration IE, the LMU shall overwrite the previously received measurement configuration information.
8.2.2.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.2.2.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the LMU cannot identify the previously requested measurement to be modified, it shall ignore the MEASUREMENT UPDATE message without taking further action.
8.2.3	Measurement Abort
8.2.3.1	General
The purpose of the Measurement Abort Procedure is to enable the E-SMLC to abort  an on-going measurement identified by the E-SMLC Measurement ID.
8.2.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.3.2.1: Measurement Abort Procedure: Successful Operation.
The E-SMLC initiates the procedure by sending a MEASUREMENT ABORT message.
Upon receiving this message, the LMU shall terminate the on-going measurement identified by the E-SMLC Measurement ID and may release any resources previously allocated for the same measurement.
8.2.3.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.2.3.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the LMU cannot identify the previously requested measurement to be aborted, it shall ignore the MEASUREMENT ABORT message without taking further action.
8.3	Management procedures
The following paragraphs describe the SLmAP interface management procedures.
8.3.1	SLm Setup
8.3.1.1	General
The purpose of the Setup procedure is to exchange application level data needed for the E-SMLC and the LMU to correctly interoperate on the SLm interface. This procedure shall be the first SLmAP procedure triggered after the TNL association has become operational.
8.3.1.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.1.2.1: SLm Setup procedure: Successful Operation.
The LMU initiates the procedure by sending the SLm SETUP REQUEST message to the E-SMLC including the appropriate data. The E-SMLC responds with an SLm SETUP RESPONSE message.
The exchanged data shall be stored in respective node and used for the duration of the TNL association. When this procedure is finished, the SLm interface is operational and other SLmAP messages can be exchanged.
8.3.1.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.3.1.3.1: SLm Setup procedure: Unsuccessful Operation.
If the E-SMLC cannot accept the setup, it shall respond with an SLm SETUP FAILURE with an appropriate cause value.
8.3.1.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.3.2	Reset
8.3.2.1	General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the LMU SLmAP contexts in the event of a failure in either the LMU or E-SMLC. This procedure does not affect the application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the SLm Setup procedure.
8.3.2.2	Successful Operation
8.3.2.2.1	Reset Procedure Initiated from the E-SMLC

Figure 8.3.2.2.1.1: Reset procedure initiated from the E-SMLC.
In the event of a failure at the E-SMLC, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET REQUEST message should be sent to the LMU.
At reception of the RESET REQUEST message the LMU shall abort any other ongoing procedure (except another Reset procedure) on the same SLm interface, delete any measurement information related to the E-SMLC, release associated resources, and respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
8.3.2.2.2	Reset Procedure Initiated from the LMU

Figure 8.3.2.2.2.1: Reset procedure initiated from the LMU.
In the event of a failure at the LMU, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET REQUEST message shall be sent to the E-SMLC.
At reception of the RESET REQUEST message the E-SMLC shall abort any other ongoing procedure (except another Reset procedure) on the same SLm interface, delete any measurement information related to the LMU, release associated resources, and respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
8.3.2.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Void.
8.3.2.4	Abnormal Conditions
If a Reset procedure is ongoing in the LMU concerning one requesting E-SMLC and the LMU receives a RESET message from the same E-SMLC, the LMU shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.3.2.2.1.
If a Reset procedure is ongoing in the E-SMLC concerning one requesting LMU and the E-SMLC receives a RESET message from the same LMU, the E-SMLC shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.3.2.2.2.
If the requesting entity does not receive RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, the requesting entity may reinitiate the Reset procedure towards the same receiving entity provided that the content of the new RESET REQUEST message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged RESET REQUEST message.
8.3.3	Error Indication
8.3.3.1	General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node in order to report detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an appropriate failure message.
8.3.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.3.2.1: Error Indication procedure
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE.

9.2	Information Element Definitions
9.2.1	General
Subclause 9.2 presents the SLmAP IE definitions in tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.3. In case there is contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following tables. In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the related capability is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause values indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.
Radio Network Layer cause
Meaning
Unknown or already allocated SLmAP ID
The action failed because the SLmAP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the LMU) is known and already allocated to an existing context.
RF frequency bands not supported
The LMU does not support UL RTOA measurements in the requested RF band or RF band combinations for a CA UE.
RF bandwidth combination for a CA UE not supported
The LMU does not support UL RTOA measurements for a CA UE over the requested RF bandwidth or RF bandwidth combinations.
Invalid SRS configuration
The received SRS configuration for the target UE was not valid.
Unspecified
Sent when none of the above cause values applies but still the cause is Location Measurement related.

Protocol cause
Meaning
Transfer Syntax Error
The received message included a transfer syntax error.
Abstract Syntax Error (Reject)
The received message included an abstract syntax error and the concerning criticality indicated "reject".
Abstract Syntax Error (Ignore And Notify)
The received message included an abstract syntax error and the concerning criticality indicated "ignore and notify".
Message Not Compatible With LMU State
The received message was not compatible with the LMU state.
Semantic Error
The received message included a semantic error.
Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)
The received message contained IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences.
Unspecified
Sent when none of the above cause values applies but still the cause is Protocol related.

Miscellaneous cause
Meaning
Control Processing Overload
Control processing overload.
Not Enough Processing Resources Available
No enough resources are available related to location processing.
Hardware Failure
Action related to hardware failure.
O&M Intervention
The action is due to O&M intervention.
Unspecified Failure
Sent when none of the above cause values applies and the cause is not related to either the Location Processing or Protocol categories.

9.2.11	Criticality Diagnostics
The Criticality Diagnostics IE is sent by the E-SMLC or the LMU when parts of a received message have not been comprehended or were missing, or if the message contained logical errors. When applicable, it contains information about which IEs were not comprehended or were missing. The conditions for inclusion of the SLmAP Transaction ID IE are described in clause 10.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.1	General
Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the SLmAP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of SLmAP messages. SLmAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct a SLmAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules (Note that in the following IE means an IE in the object set with an explicit id. If one IE needed to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
If a SLmAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
9.3.2	Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor inter-operability.
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.
