3	Definitions and Abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in [1], [2] and [3] apply. Other definitions are provided below.
Anchor carrier: In NB-IoT, a carrier where the UE assumes that NPSS/NSSS/NPBCH/SIB-NB are transmitted.
Location Server: a physical or logical entity (e.g., E-SMLC or SUPL SLP) that manages positioning for a target device by obtaining measurements and other location information from one or more positioning units and providing assistance data to positioning units to help determine this. A Location Server may also compute or verify the final location estimate.
NB-IoT: NB-IoT allows access to network services via E-UTRA with a channel bandwidth limited to 200 kHz.
Reference Source: a physical entity or part of a physical entity that provides signals (e.g., RF, acoustic, infra-red) that can be measured (e.g., by a Target Device) in order to obtain the location of a Target Device.
Target Device: the device that is being positioned (e.g., UE or SUPL SET).
Transmission Point (TP): A set of geographically co-located transmit antennas for one cell, part of one cell or one PRS-only TP. Transmission Points can include base station (eNodeB) antennas, remote radio heads, a remote antenna of a base station, an antenna of a PRS-only TP, etc. One cell can be formed by one or multiple transmission points. For a homogeneous deployment, each transmission point may correspond to one cell.
Observed Time Difference Of Arrival (OTDOA): The time interval that is observed by a target device between the reception of downlink signals from two different TPs. If a signal from TP 1 is received at the moment t1, and a signal from TP 2 is received at the moment t2, the OTDOA is t2 –  t1.
PRS-only TP: A TP which only transmits PRS signals for PRS-based TBS positioning and is not associated with a cell.

4	Functionality of Protocol
4.1	General
4.1.1	LPP Configuration
LPP is used point-to-point between a location server (E-SMLC or SLP) and a target device (UE or SET) in order to position the target device using position-related measurements obtained by one or more reference sources. Figure 4.1.1-1 shows the configuration as applied to the control- and user-plane location solutions for E-UTRAN (as defined in [2] and [3]).
NB-IoT is a non-backward compatible variant of E-UTRAN supporting a reduced set of functionalities. In this specification, procedures and messages specified for the UE equally apply to the UE in NB-IoT.

Figure 4.1.1-1: LPP Configuration for Control- and User-Plane Positioning in E-UTRAN
4.1.2	LPP Sessions and Transactions
An LPP session is used between a Location Server and the target device in order to obtain location related measurements or a location estimate or to transfer assistance data.  A single LPP session is used to support a single location request (e.g., for a single MT-LR, MO-LR or NI-LR). Multiple LPP sessions can be used between the same endpoints to support multiple different location requests (as required by [3]).  Each LPP session comprises one or more LPP transactions, with each LPP transaction performing a single operation (capability exchange, assistance data transfer, or location information transfer). In E-UTRAN the LPP transactions are realized as LPP procedures. The instigator of an LPP session will always instigate the first LPP transaction, but subsequent transactions may be instigated by either end. LPP transactions within a session may occur serially or in parallel. LPP transactions are indicated at the LPP protocol level with a transaction ID in order to associate messages with one another (e.g., request and response).
Messages within a transaction are linked by a common transaction identifier.
4.1.3	LPP Position Methods
Internal LPP positioning methods and associated signalling content are defined in this specification.
This version of the specification defines OTDOA, A-GNSS, E-CID, Barometric Sensor, TBS, WLAN, and Bluetooth positioning methods.
4.1.4	LPP Messages
Each LPP transaction involves the exchange of one or more LPP messages between the location server and the target device.  The general format of an LPP message consists of a set of common fields followed by a body.  The body (which may be empty) contains information specific to a particular message type. Each message type contains information specific to one or more positioning methods and/or information common to all positioning methods.
The common fields are as follows:
Field
Role
Transaction ID
Identify messages belonging to the same transaction
Transaction End Flag
Indicate when a transaction (e.g. one with periodic responses) has ended
Sequence Number
Enable detection of a duplicate LPP message at a receiver
Acknowledgement
Enable an acknowledgement to be requested and/or returned for any LPP message

NOTE:	Use of the Transaction ID and Transaction End fields conform to the procedures in clause 5 and are independent of the means used to transport LPP messages (e.g., whether using a NAS MO-LR Request, NAS Generic Transport or user-plane solution).
The following message types are defined:
-	Request Capabilities;
-	Provide Capabilities;
-	Request Assistance Data;
-	Provide Assistance Data;
-	Request Location Information;
-	Provide Location Information;
-	Abort;
-	Error.
4.2	Common LPP Session Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to support an LPP session comprising a sequence of LPP transactions. The procedure is described in Figure 4.2-1.

Figure 4.2-1 LPP Session Procedure
1.	Endpoint A, which may be either the target or the server, initiates an LPP session by sending an LPP message for an initial LPP transaction  j to the other endpoint B (which has an opposite role to A).
2.	Endpoints A and B may exchange further messages to continue the transaction started in step 1.
3.	Either endpoint may instigate further transactions by sending additional LPP messages.
4.	A session is terminated by a final transaction N in which LPP messages will be exchanged between the two endpoints.
Within each transaction, all constituent messages shall contain the same transaction identifier.  The last message sent in each transaction shall have the IE endTransaction  set to TRUE.  Transactions that occur in parallel shall use different transaction IDs; transaction IDs for completed transactions may be reused at any time after the final message of the previous transaction with the same ID is known to have been received.
4.3	LPP Transport
4.3.1	Transport Layer Requirements
LPP requires reliable, in-sequence delivery of LPP messages from the underlying transport layers. This section describes the transport capabilities that are available within LPP. A UE implementing LPP for the control-plane solution shall support LPP reliable transport (including all three of duplicate detection, acknowledgement, and retransmission).
LPP reliable transport functionality is not used in the user-plane solution.
The following requirements in subclauses 4.3.2, 4.3.3, and 4.3.4 for LPP reliable transport apply only when the capability is supported.
4.3.2	LPP Duplicate Detection
A sender shall include a sequence number in all LPP messages sent for a particular location session. The sequence number shall be distinct for different LPP messages sent in the same direction in the same location session (e.g., may start at zero in the first LPP message and increase monotonically in each succeeding LPP message). Sequence numbers used in the uplink and downlink are independent (e.g., can be the same).
A receiver shall record the most recent received sequence number for each location session. If a message is received carrying the same sequence number as that last received for the associated location session, it shall be discarded. Otherwise (i.e., if the sequence number is different or if no sequence number was previously received or if no sequence number is included), the message shall be processed.
Sending and receiving sequence numbers shall be deleted in a server when the associated location session is terminated and shall be deleted in a target device when there has been no activity for a particular location session for 10 minutes.
NOTE:	For LPP control-plane use, a target device can be aware of a location session from information provided at the NAS level for downlink transport of an LPP message.
4.3.3	LPP Acknowledgement
4.3.3.1	General
Each LPP message may carry an acknowledgement request and/or an acknowledgement indicator. A LPP message including an acknowledgement request (i.e., that include the IE ackRequested set to TRUE) shall also include a sequence number. Upon reception of an LPP message which includes the IE ackRequested set to TRUE, a receiver returns an LPP message with an acknowledgement response (i.e., that includes the ackIndicator IE set to the same sequence number of the message being acknowledged). An acknowledgement response may contain no LPP message body (in which case only the sequence number being acknowledged is significant); alternatively, the acknowledgement may be sent in an LPP message along with an LPP message body. An acknowledgement is returned for each received LPP message that requested an acknowledgement including any duplicate(s). Once a sender receives an acknowledgement for an LPP message, and provided any included sequence number is matching, it is permitted to send the next LPP message. No message reordering is needed at the receiver since this stop-and-wait method of sending ensures that messages normally arrive in the correct order.
When an LPP message is transported via a NAS MO-LR request, the message does not request an acknowledgement.
4.3.3.2	Procedure related to Acknowledgement
Figure 4.3.3.2-1 shows the procedure related to acknowledgement.

Figure 4.3.3.2-1: LPP Acknowledgement procedure
1.	Endpoint A sends an LPP message N to Endpoint B which includes the IE ackRequested set to TRUE and a sequence number.
2.	If LPP message N is received and Endpoint B is able to decode the ackRequested value and sequence number, Endpoint B shall return an acknowledgement for message N. The acknowledgement shall contain the IE ackIndicator set to the same sequence number as that in message N.
3.	When the acknowledgement for LPP message N is received and provided the included ackIndicator IE matches the sequence number sent in message N, Endpoint A sends the next LPP message N+1 to Endpoint B when this message is available.
4.3.4	LPP Retransmission
4.3.4.1	General
This capability builds on the acknowledgement and duplicate detection capabilities. When an LPP message which requires acknowledgement is sent and not acknowledged, it is resent by the sender following a timeout period up to three times. If still unacknowledged after that, the sender aborts all LPP activity for the associated session. The timeout period is determined by the sender implementation but shall not be less than a minimum value of 250ms.
In addition, for NB-IoT the timeout period may be determined by the sender implementation based on e.g., the coverage level of the UE.
4.3.4.2	Procedure related to Retransmission
Figure 4.3.4.2-1 shows the procedure related to retransmission when combined with acknowledgement and duplicate detection.

Figure 4.3.4.2-1: LPP Retransmission procedure
1.	Endpoint A sends an LPP message N to Endpoint B for a particular location session and includes a request for acknowledgement along with a sequence number.
2.	If LPP message N is received and Endpoint B is able to decode the ackRequested value and sequence number (regardless of whether the message body can be correctly decoded), Endpoint B shall return an acknowledgement for message N. If the acknowledgement is received by Endpoint A (such that the acknowledged message can be identified and sequence numbers are matching), Endpoint A skips steps 3 and 4.
3.	If the acknowledgement in step 2 is not received after a timeout period, Endpoint A shall retransmit LPP message N and shall include the same sequence number as in step 1.
4.	If LPP message N in step 3 is received and Endpoint B is able to decode the ackRequested value and sequence number (regardless of whether the message body can be correctly decoded and whether or not the message is considered a duplicate), Endpoint B shall return an acknowledgement. Steps 3 may be repeated one or more times if the acknowledgement in step 4 is not received after a timeout period by Endpoint A. If the acknowledgement in step 4 is still not received after sending three retransmissions, Endpoint A shall abort all procedures and activity associated with LPP support for the particular location session.
5.	Once an acknowledgement in step 2 or step 4 is received, Endpoint A sends the next LPP message N+1 for the location session to Endpoint B when this message is available.
4.3.5	LPP Message Segmentation
An LPP message body may be sent in several shorter LPP messages instead of one long LPP message to deliver a large amount of information (e.g., in case the LPP message size exceeds the maximum message size supported by lower layers). When a sender employs LPP message segmentation, the sender shall include the IE SegmentationInfo in each LPP message segment. The sender shall indicate in all but the final message segment that more messages are on the way.
When a receiver receives an LPP message indicating that more messages are on the way, the receiver may store the LPP message. If the receiver receives a subsequent LPP message for the same session and transaction ID, the receiver shall assume that the new LPP message continues the segmentation of the earlier message and may store the new message if the new message indicates that more messages are on the way. If the new message indicates that no more messages are on the way, the receiver shall assume that message segmentation is complete and shall process the new message and any stored message segments for the same session and transaction ID.
The reliable transport rules specified in sub-clause 4.3.2, 4.3.3, and 4.3.4 apply to each individual LPP message segment, independently of the value of the IE SegmentationInfo.
The rules for setting the common fields of the LPP message specified in sub-clause 4.1.4 (Transaction ID, Transaction End Flag, Sequence Number, Acknowledgment) apply to each individual LPP message segment, independently of the value of the IE SegmentationInfo.

Figure 4.3.5-1: LPP Message Segmentation procedure
1.	Endpoint A sends an LPP message to Endpoint B for a particular location session and includes the IE SegmentationInfo set to moreMessagesOnTheWay to indicate that this is one of many LPP message segments used to deliver the entire LPP message body.
2	Endpoint A may send one or more additional LPP messages to Endpoint B with the IE SegmentationInfo set to moreMessagesOnTheWay to continue delivering the segmented LPP message.
3.	Endpoint A sends the final LPP message segment to Endpoint B and includes the IE SegmentationInfo set to noMoreMessages to indicate that this is the final LPP message segment. Endpoint B assumes that the complete LPP message body has been received.
5	LPP Procedures
5.1	Procedures related to capability transfer
The purpose of the procedures that are grouped together in this section is to enable the transfer of capabilities from the target device to the server. Capabilities in this context refer to positioning and protocol capabilities related to LPP and the positioning methods supported by LPP.
These procedures instantiate the Capability Transfer transaction from 3GPP TS 36.305 [2].
5.1.1	Capability Transfer procedure
The Capability Transfer procedure is shown in Figure 5.1.1-1.

Figure 5.1.1-1: LPP Capability Transfer procedure
1.	The server sends a RequestCapabilities message to the target. The server may indicate the types of capability needed.
2.	The target responds with a ProvideCapabilities message to the server. The capabilities shall correspond to any capability types specified in step 1. This message shall include the endTransaction IE set to TRUE.
5.1.2	Capability Indication procedure
The Capability Indication procedure allows the target to provide unsolicited capabilities to the server and is shown in Figure 5.1.2-1.

Figure 5.1.2-1: LPP Capability Indication procedure
1.	The target sends a ProvideCapabilities message to the server. This message shall include the endTransaction IE set to TRUE.
5.1.3	Reception of LPP Request Capabilities
Upon receiving a RequestCapabilities message, the target device shall generate a ProvideCapabilities message as a response.
The target device shall:
1>	for each positioning method for which a request for capabilities is included in the message:
2>	if the target device supports this positioning method:
3>	include the capabilities of the device for that supported positioning method in the response message;
1>	set the IE LPP-TransactionID in the response message to the same value as the IE LPP-TransactionID in the received message;
1>	deliver the response message to lower layers for transmission.
5.1.4	Transmission of LPP Provide Capabilities
When triggered to transmit a ProvideCapabilities message, the target device shall:
1>	for each positioning method whose capabilities are to be indicated:
2>	set the corresponding IE to include the device's capabilities;
2>	if OTDOA capabilities are to be indicated:
3>	include the IE supportedBandListEUTRA;
1>	deliver the response to lower layers for transmission.
5.2	Procedures related to Assistance Data Transfer
The purpose of the procedures in this section is to enable the target to request assistance data from the server to assist in positioning, and to enable the server to transfer assistance data to the target in the absence of a request.
These procedures instantiate the Assistance Data Transfer transaction from 3GPP TS 36.305 [2].
5.2.1	Assistance Data Transfer procedure
The Assistance Data Transfer procedure is shown in Figure 5.2.1-1.

Figure 5.2.1-1: LPP Assistance data transfer procedure
1.	The target sends a RequestAssistanceData message to the server.
2.	The server responds with a ProvideAssistanceData message to the target containing assistance data. The transferred assistance data should match or be a subset of the assistance data requested in step 1. The server may also provide any not requested information that it considers useful to the target. If step 3 does not occur, this message shall set the endTransaction IE to TRUE.
3.	The server may transmit one or more additional ProvideAssistanceData messages to the target containing further assistance data. The transferred assistance data should match or be a subset of the assistance data requested in step 1. The server may also provide any not requested information that it considers useful to the target. The last message shall include the endTransaction IE set to TRUE.
5.2.2	Assistance Data Delivery procedure
The Assistance Data Delivery procedure allows the server to provide unsolicited assistance data to the target and is shown in Figure 5.2.2-1.

Figure 5.2.2-1: LPP Assistance data transfer procedure
1.	The server sends a ProvideAssistanceData message to the target containing assistance data. If step 2 does not occur, this message shall set the endTransaction IE to TRUE.
2.	The server may transmit one or more additional ProvideAssistanceData messages to the target containing additional assistance data. The last message shall include the endTransaction IE set to TRUE.
5.2.3	Transmission of LPP Request Assistance Data
When triggered to transmit a RequestAssistanceData message, the target device shall:
1>	set the IEs for the positioning-method-specific request for assistance data to request the data indicated by upper layers.
5.2.4	Reception of LPP Provide Assistance Data
Upon receiving a ProvideAssistanceData message, the target device shall:
1>	for each positioning method contained in the message:
2>	deliver the related assistance data to upper layers.
5.3	Procedures related to Location Information Transfer
The purpose of the procedures in this section is to enable the server to request location measurement data and/or a location estimate from the target, and to enable the target to transfer location measurement data and/or a location estimate to a server in the absence of a request.
These procedures instantiate the Location Information Transfer transaction in 3GPP TS 36.305 [2].
NOTE:	The service layer (e.g. NAS or OMA SUPL ULP) would be used to transfer information associated with a location request from a target to a server (MO-LR).
5.3.1	Location Information Transfer procedure
The Location Information Transfer procedure is shown in Figure 5.3.1-1.


Figure 5.3.1-1: LPP Location Information transfer procedure
1.	The server sends a RequestLocationInformation message to the target to request location information, indicating the type of location information needed and potentially the associated QoS.
2.	The target sends a ProvideLocationInformation message to the server to transfer location information. The location information transferred should match or be a subset of the location information requested in step 1 unless the server explicitly allows additional location information. If step 3 does not occur, this message shall set the endTransaction IE to TRUE.
3.	If requested in step 1, the target sends additional ProvideLocationInformation messages to the server to transfer location information. The location information transferred should match or be a subset of the location information requested in step 1 unless the server explicitly allows additional location information. The last message shall include the endTransaction IE set to TRUE.
5.3.2	Location Information Delivery procedure
The Location Information Delivery allows the target to provide unsolicited location information to the server. The procedure is shown in Figure 5.3.2-1.


Figure 5.3.2-1: LPP Location Information Delivery procedure
1.	The target sends a ProvideLocationInformation message to the server to transfer location information. If step 2 does not occur, this message shall set the endTransaction IE to TRUE.
2.	The target may send one or more additional ProvideLocationInformation messages to the server containing additional location information data. The last message shall include the endTransaction IE set to TRUE.
5.3.3	Reception of Request Location Information
Upon receiving a RequestLocationInformation message, the target device shall:
1>	if the requested information is compatible with the target device capabilities and configuration:
2>	include the requested information in a ProvideLocationInformation message;
2>	set the IE LPP-TransactionID in the response to the same value as the IE LPP-TransactionID in the received message;
2>	deliver the ProvideLocationInformation message to lower layers for transmission.
1>	otherwise:
2>	if one or more positioning methods are included that the target device does not support:
3>	continue to process the message as if it contained only information for the supported positioning methods;
3>	handle the signaling content of the unsupported positioning methods by LPP error detection as in 5.4.3.
5.3.4	Transmission of Provide Location Information
When triggered to transmit ProvideLocationInformation message, the target device shall:
1>	for each positioning method contained in the message:
2>	set the corresponding IE to include the available location information;
1>	deliver the response to lower layers for transmission.
5.4	Error Handling Procedures
5.4.1	General
This sub-clause describes how a receiving entity (target device or location server) behaves in cases when it receives erroneous or unexpected data or detects that certain data are missing.
5.4.2	Procedures related to Error Indication
Figure 5.4.2-1 shows the Error indication procedure.

Figure 5.4.2-1: LPP Error Indication procedure
1.	Endpoint A sends an LPP message to Endpoint B.
2.	Endpoint B determines that the LPP message in step 1 contains an error. Endpoint B returns an Error message to Endpoint A indicating the error or errors and discards the message in step 1. If Endpoint B is able to determine that the erroneous LPP message in step 1 is an LPP Error or Abort Message, Endpoint B discards the message in step 1 without returning an Error message to Endpoint A.
5.4.3	LPP Error Detection
Upon receiving any LPP message, the receiving entity shall attempt to decode the message and verify the presence of any errors and:
1>	if decoding errors are encountered:
2>	if the receiver can not determine that the received message is an LPP Error or Abort message:
3>	return an LPP Error message to the sender and include the received LPP-TransactionID, if this was decoded, and type of error;
3>	if the receiver can determine the session and the LPP-TransactionID and the received message includes the IE SegmentationInfo and the receiver has previously stored message segments for this session and LPP-TransactionID:
4>	discard all stored LPP message segments for this session and LPP-TransactionID;
3>	discard the received message and stop the error detection procedure;
1>	if the message is a duplicate of a previously received message:
2>	discard the message and stop the error detection procedure;
1>	if the LPP-TransactionID matches the LPP-TransactionID for a procedure that is still ongoing for the same session and the message type is invalid for the current state of the procedure:
2>	abort the ongoing procedure;
2>	return an LPP Error message to the sender and include the received transaction ID and type of error;
2>	if the message includes the IE SegmentationInfo and the receiver has previously stored message segments for this session and LPP-TransactionID:
3>	discard all stored LPP message segments for this session and LPP-TransactionID;
2>	discard the message and stop the error detection procedure;
1>	if the message includes the IE SegmentationInfo:
2>	if the receiver has previously stored LPP message segments for this session and LPP-TransactionID:
3>	if the received message type is different to the stored message type:
4>	return an LPP Error message to the sender and include the received transaction ID and type of error;
4>	discard the message and all stored LPP message segments for this session and LPP-TransactionID and stop the error detection procedure;
2>	if the IE SegmentationInfo has the value moreMessagesOnTheWay:
3>	store the received message;
NOTE:	As an implementation option, the receiver of an LPP Provide Assistance Data or LPP Provide Location Information message may process the received message segment instead of storing the message.
2>	if the IE SegmentationInfo has the value noMoreMessages:
3>	continue error detection for the received message and any stored LPP message segments for this session and LPP-TransactionID;
1> if the message type is an LPP RequestCapabilities and some of the requested information is not supported:
2>	return any information that can be provided in a normal response.
1>	if the message type is an LPP RequestAssistanceData or RequestLocationInformation and some or all of the requested information is not supported:
2>	return any information that can be provided in a normal response, which includes indications on other information that is not supported.
5.4.4	Reception of an LPP Error Message
Upon receiving an Error message, a device shall:
1>	abort any ongoing procedure associated with the LPP-TransactionID if included in the received message.
The device may:
1>	restart the aborted procedure taking into consideration the returned error information.
5.5	Abort Procedure
5.5.1	General
The purpose of the abort procedure is to allow the target device or location server to abort an ongoing procedure due to some unexpected event (e.g., cancellation of a location request by an LCS client). It can also be used to stop an ongoing procedure (e.g., periodic location reporting from the target device).
5.5.2	Procedures related to Abort
Figure 5.5.2-1 shows the Abort procedure.

Figure 5.5.2-1: LPP Abort procedure
1.	A procedure P is ongoing between endpoints A and B.
2.	Endpoint A determines that the procedure must be aborted and sends an Abort message to Endpoint B carrying the transaction ID for procedure P. Endpoint B aborts procedure P.
5.5.3	Reception of an LPP Abort Message
Upon receiving an Abort message, a device shall:
1>	abort any ongoing procedure associated with the transaction ID indicated in the message.
6	Information Element Abstract Syntax Definition
6.1	General
The contents of each LPP message is specified in sub-clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further detailed information about the fields specified in the message syntax.
The ASN.1 in this section uses the same format and coding conventions as described in Annex A of [12].
Transfer syntax for LPP messages is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by use of Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER), Unaligned Variant, as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [22]. The encoded LPP message always contains a multiple of 8 bits.
Transfer syntax for LPP IEs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by use of Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER), Unaligned Variant, as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [22]. The encoded LPP IE always contains a multiple of 8 bits. This applies when a single LPP IE is encoded as the basic production, i.e. for other purposes than encoding the LPP IE within an LPP message.
The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1-1.  These tags are used in the downlink (server to target) direction only.
Table 6.1-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields to be present
Abbreviation
Meaning
Cond conditionTag

Conditionally present
A field for which the need is specified by means of conditions. For each conditionTag, the need is specified in a tabular form following the ASN.1 segment. In case, according to the conditions, a field is not present, the target takes no action and where applicable shall continue to use the existing value (and/or the associated functionality) unless explicitly stated otherwise in the description of the field itself.
Need OP

Optionally present
A field that is optional to signal. For downlink messages, the target is not required to take any special action on absence of the field beyond what is specified in the procedural text or the field description table following the ASN.1 segment. The target behaviour on absence should be captured either in the procedural text or in the field description.
Need ON

Optionally present, No action
A field that is optional to signal. If the message is received by the target, and in case the field is absent, the target takes no action and where applicable shall continue to use the existing value (and/or the associated functionality).
Need OR

Optionally present, Release
A field that is optional to signal. If the message is received by the target, and in case the field is absent, the target shall discontinue/ stop using/ delete any existing value (and/ or the associated functionality).

When specifying information elements which are to be represented by BIT STRINGs, if not otherwise specifically stated in the field description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	the last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB).

CommonIEsRequestLocationInformation  field descriptions
locationInformationType
This IE indicates whether the server requires a location estimate or measurements. For 'locationEstimateRequired', the target device shall return a location estimate if possible, or indicate a location error if not possible. For 'locationMeasurementsRequired', the target device shall return measurements if possible, or indicate a location error if not possible. For 'locationEstimatePreferred', the target device shall return a location estimate if possible, but may also or instead return measurements for any requested position methods for which a location estimate is not possible. For 'locationMeasurementsPreferred', the target device shall return location measurements if possible, but may also or instead return a location estimate for any requested position methods for which return of location measurements is not possible.
triggeredReporting
This IE indicates that triggered reporting is requested and comprises the following subfields:
-	cellChange: If this field is set to TRUE, the target device provides requested location information each time the primary cell has changed.
-	reportingDuration: Maximum duration of triggered reporting in seconds. A value of zero is interpreted to mean an unlimited (i.e. "infinite") duration. The target device should continue triggered reporting for the reportingDuration or until an LPP Abort or LPP Error message is received.
The triggeredReporting field should not be included by the location server and shall be ignored by the target device if the periodicalReporting IE or responseTime IE or responseTimeNB IE is included in CommonIEsRequestLocationInformation.
periodicalReporting
This IE indicates that periodic reporting is requested and comprises the following subfields:
-	reportingAmount indicates the number of periodic location information reports requested. Enumerated values correspond to 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or infinite/indefinite number of reports. If the reportingAmount is 'infinite/indefinite', the target device shou-ld continue periodic reporting until an LPP Abort message is received. The value 'ra1' shall not be used by a sender.
-	reportingInterval indicates the interval between location information reports and the response time requirement for the first location information report.  Enumerated values ri0-25, ri0-5, ri1, ri2, ri4, ri8, ri16, ri32, ri64 correspond to reporting intervals of 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 16, 20, 32, and 64 seconds, respectively. Measurement reports containing no measurements or no location estimate are required when a reportingInterval expires before a target device is able to obtain new measurements or obtain a new location estimate. The value 'noPeriodicalReporting' shall not be used by a sender.
additionalInformation
This IE indicates whether a target device is allowed to return additional information to that requested. If this IE indicates 'onlyReturnInformationRequested' then the target device shall not return any additional information to that requested by the server. If this IE indicates 'mayReturnAdditionalInformation' then the target device may return additional information to that requested by the server. If a location estimate is returned, any additional information is restricted to that associated with a location estimate (e.g. might include velocity if velocity was not requested but cannot include measurements). If measurements are returned, any additional information is restricted to additional measurements (e.g. might include E-CID measurements if A-GNSS measurements were requested but not E-CID measurements).
qos
This IE indicates the quality of service and comprises a number of sub-fields. In the case of measurements, some of the sub-fields apply to the location estimate that could be obtained by the server from the measurements provided by the target device assuming that the measurements are the only sources of error. Fields are as follows:
-	horizontalAccuracy indicates the maximum horizontal error in the location estimate at an indicated confidence level. The 'accuracy' corresponds to the encoded uncertainty as defined in 3GPP TS 23.032 [15] and 'confidence' corresponds to confidence as defined in 3GPP TS 23.032 [15].
-	verticalCoordinateRequest indicates whether a vertical coordinate is required (TRUE) or not (FALSE)
-	verticalAccuracy indicates the maximum vertical error in the location estimate at an indicated confidence level and is only applicable when a vertical coordinate is requested. The 'accuracy' corresponds to the encoded uncertainty altitude as defined in 3GPP TS 23.032 [15] and 'confidence' corresponds to confidence as defined in 3GPP TS 23.032 [15].
-	responseTime
-	time indicates the maximum response time as measured between receipt of the RequestLocationInformation and transmission of a ProvideLocationInformation. This is given as an integer number of seconds between 1 and 128. If the periodicalReporting IE is included in CommonIEsRequestLocationInformation, this field should not be included by the location server and shall be ignored by the target device (if included).
-	responseTimeEarlyFix indicates the maximum response time as measured between receipt of the RequestLocationInformation and transmission of a ProvideLocationInformation containing early location measurements or an early location estimate. This is given as an integer number of seconds between 1 and 128. When this IE is included, a target should send a ProvideLocationInformation (or more than one ProvideLocationInformation if location information will not fit into a single message) containing early location information according to the responseTimeEarlyFix IE and a subsequent ProvideLocationInformation (or more than one ProvideLocationInformation if location information will not fit into a single message) containing final location information according to the time IE. A target shall omit sending a ProvideLocationInformation if the early location information is not available at the expiration of the time value in the responseTimeEarlyFix IE. A server should set the responseTimeEarlyFix IE to a value less than that for the time IE. A target shall ignore the responseTimeEarlyFix IE if its value is not less than that for the time IE.
-	velocityRequest indicates whether velocity (or measurements related to velocity) is requested (TRUE) or not (FALSE).
-	responseTimeNB
If the periodicalReporting IE or responseTime IE is included in CommonIEsRequestLocationInformation, this field should not be included by the location server and shall be ignored by the target device (if included).
-	timeNB indicates the maximum response time as measured between receipt of the RequestLocationInformation and transmission of a ProvideLocationInformation. This is given as an integer number of seconds between 1 and 512.
-	responseTimeEarlyFixNB indicates the maximum response time as measured between receipt of the RequestLocationInformation and transmission of a ProvideLocationInformation containing early location measurements or an early location estimate. This is given as an integer number of seconds between 1 and 512. When this IE is included, a target should send a ProvideLocationInformation (or more than one ProvideLocationInformation if location information will not fit into a single message) containing early location information according to the responseTimeEarlyFixNB IE and a subsequent ProvideLocationInformation (or more than one ProvideLocationInformation if location information will not fit into a single message) containing final location information according to the timeNB IE. A target shall omit sending a ProvideLocationInformation if the early location information is not available at the expiration of the time value in the responseTimeEarlyFixNB IE. A server should set the responseTimeEarlyFixNB IE to a value less than that for the timeNB IE. A target shall ignore the responseTimeEarlyFixNB IE if its value is not less than that for the timeNB IE.
All QoS requirements shall be obtained by the target device to the degree possible but it is permitted to return a response that does not fulfill all QoS requirements if some were not attainable. The single exception is time and timeNB which shall always be fulfilled – even if that means not fulfilling other QoS requirements.
A target device supporting NB-IoT access shall support the responseTimeNB IE.
environment
This field provides the target device with information about expected multipath and non line of sight (NLOS) in the current area. The following values are defined:
-	badArea:	possibly heavy multipath and NLOS conditions (e.g. bad urban or urban).
-	notBadArea:	no or light multipath and usually LOS conditions (e.g. suburban or rural).
-	mixedArea:	environment that is mixed or not defined.
If this field is absent, a default value of 'mixedArea' applies.
locationCoordinateTypes
This field provides a list of the types of location estimate that the target device may return when a location estimate is obtained by the target.
velocityTypes
This fields provides a list of the types of velocity estimate that the target device may return when a velocity estimate is obtained by the target.
messageSizeLimitNB
This field provides an octet limit on the amount of location information a target device can return.
-	measurementLimit indicates the maximum amount of location information the target device should return in response to the RequestLocationInformation message received from the location server.
The limit applies to the overall size of the LPP message at LPP level (LPP Provide Location Information), and is specified in steps of 100 octets. The message size limit is then given by the value provided in measurementLimit times 100 octets.
segmentationInfo
This field indicates whether this RequestLocationInformation message is one of many segments, as specified in sub‑clause 4.3.5

6.5	Positioning Method IEs
6.5.1	OTDOA Positioning
This subclause defines the information elements for downlink OTDOA positioning, which includes TBS positioning based on PRS signals [2].
6.5.1.1	OTDOA Assistance Data
–	OTDOA-ProvideAssistanceData
The IE OTDOA-ProvideAssistanceData is used by the location server to provide assistance data to enable UE‑assisted downlink OTDOA. It may also be used to provide OTDOA positioning specific error reason.
Throughout Section 6.5.1, "assistance data reference cell" refers to the cell defined by the IE OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo and "NB-IoT assistance data reference cell" refers to the cell defined by the IE OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfoNB (see section 6.5.1.2). "RSTD reference cell" applies only in Section 6.5.1.5.
If both IEs, OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo and OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfoNB are included in OTDOA‑ProvideAssistanceData, the assistance data reference cell and NB-IoT assistance data reference cell correspond to the same cell, and the target device may assume that PRS and NPRS antenna ports are quasi co-located, as defined in [16].
Throughout Section 6.5.1, the term "cell" refers to "transmission point (TP)", unless distinguished in the field description.
NOTE 1:	The location server should include at least one cell for which the SFN can be obtained by the target device, e.g. the serving cell, in the assistance data, either as the assistance data reference cell or in the neighbour cell list. Otherwise the target device will be unable to perform the OTDOA measurement and the positioning operation will fail.
NOTE 2:	Due to support of cells containing multiple TPs and PRS-only TPs not associated with cells, the term "cell" as used in section 6.5.1 may not always correspond to a cell for the E-UTRAN.
NOTE 3:	For NB-IoT access, due to support of NPRS on multiple carriers, the term "cell" as used in section 6.5.1 refers to the anchor carrier, unless otherwise stated.

PRS-Info field descriptions
prs-Bandwidth
This field specifies the bandwidth that is used to configure the positioning reference signals on. Enumerated values are specified in number of resource blocks (n6 corresponds to 6 resource blocks, n15 to 15 resource blocks and so on) and define 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz bandwidth.
prs-ConfigurationIndex
This field specfies the positioning reference signals configuration index IPRS as defined in [16].
numDL-Frames
This field specifies the number of consecutive downlink subframes NPRS with positioning reference signals, as defined in [16]. Enumerated values define 1, 2, 4, or 6 consecutive downlink subframes. The value sf-add indicates that NPRS is provided in the field add-numDL-Frames.
prs-MutingInfo
This field specifies the PRS muting configuration of the cell. The PRS muting configuration is defined by a periodic PRS muting sequence with periodicity TREP where TREP, counted in the number of PRS occasion groups [18], can be 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 which is also the length of the selected bit string that represents this PRS muting sequence. If a bit in the PRS muting sequence is set to "0", then the PRS is muted in all the PRS occasions in the corresponding PRS occasion group. A PRS occasion group comprises one or more PRS occasions as indicated by prsOccGroupLen. Each PRS occasion comprises NPRS downlink positioning subframes as defined in [16]. The first bit of the PRS muting sequence corresponds to the first PRS occasion group that starts after the beginning of the assistance data reference cell SFN=0. The sequence is valid for all subframes after the target device has received the prs-MutingInfo. If this field is not present the target device may assume that the PRS muting is not in use for the cell.

When the SFN of the assistance data reference cell is not known to the UE and prs-MutingInfo is provided for a cell in the OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList IE, the UE may assume no PRS is transmitted by that cell.

When the UE receives a TREP-bit muting pattern together with a PRS periodicity TPRS for the same cell which exceeds 10240 subframes (i.e., TREP × TPRS > 10240 subframes), the UE shall assume an n-bit muting pattern based on the first n‑bits, where n = 10240/TPRS.
prsID
This field specifies the PRS-ID as defined in [16].
add-numDL-Frames
This field specifies the number of consecutive downlink subframes NPRS with positioning reference signals, as defined in [16]. Integer values define 1, 2, 3, …, 160 consecutive downlink subframes.
prsOccGroupLen
This field specifies the PRS occasion group length, defined as the number of consecutive PRS occasions comprising a PRS occasion group. Each PRS occasion of the PRS occasion group consists of numDL-Frames or add-numDL-Frames consecutive downlink subframes with positioning reference signals. Enumerated values define 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 consecutive PRS occasions. If omitted, the PRS occasion group length is 1. The product of the PRS periodicity T_PRS from the prs-ConfigurationIndex and the PRS occasion group length cannot exceed 1280.
prsHoppingInfo
This field specifies the PRS frequency hopping configuration [16]. The choice nb2 indicates hopping between 2 narrowbands; the choice nb4 indicates hopping between 4 narrowbands. The first PRS positioning occasion of the first PRS occasion group that starts after the beginning of SFN=0 of the assistance data reference cell is located at the centre of the system bandwidth. The frequency band of each subsequent PRS occasion is indicated by nb2 or nb4, respectively, which defines the narrowband index as specified in TS 36.211 [16]. If this field is absent, no PRS frequency hopping is used.

–	OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList
The IE OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList is used by the location server to provide neighbour cell information for OTDOA assistance data. If the target device is not capable of supporting additional neighbour cells (as indicated by the absence of the IE additionalNeighbourCellInfoList in OTDOA-ProvideCapabilities), the set of cells in the OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList is grouped per frequency layer and in the decreasing order of priority for measurement to be performed by the target device, with the first cell in the list being the highest priority for measurement and with the same earfcn not appearing in more than one instance of OTDOA‑NeighbourFreqInfo.
If the target device is capable of supporting additional neighbour cells (as indicated by the presence of the IE additionalNeighbourCellInfoList in OTDOA-ProvideCapabilities), the list may contain all cells (up to 3x24 cells) belonging to the same frequency layer or cells from different frequency layers with the first cell in the list still being the highest priority for measurement.
The prioritization of the cells in the list is left to server implementation. The target device should provide the available measurements in the same order as provided by the server.
If inter-frequency neighbour cells are included in OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList, where an inter-frequency is a E-UTRA frequency which is different from the E-UTRA serving cell frequency, the LPP layer shall inform lower layers to start performing inter-frequency RSTD measurements for these neighbour cells and also provide to lower layers the information about these neighbour cells, e.g. EARFCN and PRS positioning occasion information.

OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList field descriptions
physCellId
This field specifies the physical cell identity of the neighbour cell, as defined in [12].
cellGlobalId
This field specifies the ECGI, the globally unique identity of a cell in E-UTRA, of the neighbour cell, as defined in [12]. The server should provide this field if it considers that it is needed to resolve any ambiguity in the cell identified by physCellId.
earfcn
This field specifies the EARFCN of the neighbour cell.
cpLength
This field specifies the cyclic prefix length of the neigbour cell PRS if PRS are present in this neighbour cell, otherwise this field specifies the cyclic prefix length of CRS in this neighbour cell.
prsInfo
This field specifies the first PRS configuration of the neighbour cell.
When the EARFCN of the neighbour cell is the same as for the assistance data reference cell, the target device may assume that each PRS positioning occasion in the neighbour cell at least partially overlaps with a PRS positioning occasion in the assistance data reference cell where the maximum offset between the transmitted PRS positioning occasions may be assumed to not exceed half a subframe.
When the EARFCN of the neighbour cell is the same as for the assistance data reference cell, the target may assume that this cell has the same PRS periodicity (TPRS) as the assistance data reference cell.
antennaPortConfig
This field specifies whether 1 (or 2) antenna port(s) or 4 antenna ports for cell specific reference signals are used.
slotNumberOffset
This field specifies the slot number offset at the transmitter between this cell and the assistance data reference cell.
The slotNumberOffset together with the current slot number of the assistance data reference cell may be used to calculate the current slot number of this cell which may further be used to generate the CRS sequence by the target device. The offset corresponds to the number of full slots counted from the beginning of a radio frame of the assistance data reference cell to the beginning of the closest subsequent radio frame of this cell. If this field is absent, the slot timing is the same as for the assistance data reference cell.
prs-SubframeOffset
This field specifies the offset between the first PRS subframe of the first PRS occasion group of the first PRS configuration in the assistance data reference cell on the reference carrier frequency layer and the first PRS subframe in the closest subsequent PRS occasion group of the PRS configuration with the longest PRS occasion group periodicity (NOTE) of this cell on the other carrier frequency layer. The value is given in number of full sub-frames.  If the EARFCN is not the same as for the assistance data reference cell and the field is not present but PRS are available on this cell, the receiver shall consider the PRS subframe offset for this cell to be 0.
expectedRSTD
If PRS is transmitted:

This field indicates the RSTD value that the target device is expected to measure between this cell and the assistance data reference cell. The expectedRSTD field takes into account the expected propagation time difference as well as transmit time difference of PRS positioning occasions between the two cells. The RSTD value can be negative and is calculated as (expectedRSTD-8192). The resolution is 3Ts,  with Ts=1/(15000*2048) seconds.

If PRS is not transmitted:

This field indicates the RSTD value that the target device is expected to measure between this cell and the assistance data reference cell. The expectedRSTD field takes into account the expected propagation time difference as well as transmit time difference between the two cells. The RSTD value can be negative and is calculated as (expectedRSTD-8192). The resolution is 3´Ts, with Ts=1/(15000*2048) seconds.
expectedRSTD-Uncertainty
If PRS is transmitted:

This field indicates the uncertainty in expectedRSTD value. The uncertainty is related to the location server's a‑priori estimation of the target device location. The expectedRSTD and expectedRSTD-Uncertainty together define the search window for the target device.
The scale factor of the expectedRSTD-Uncertainty field is 3Ts, with Ts=1/(15000*2048) seconds.

The target device may assume that the beginning of the PRS occasion group of the PRS configuration with the longest PRS occasion group periodicity (NOTE) of the neighbour cell is received within the search window of size
[ expectedRSTD-Uncertainty3Ts,  expectedRSTD-Uncertainty3Ts] centered at
TREF + 1 millisecondN + (expectedRSTD8192) 3Ts, where TREF is the reception time of the beginning of the first PRS occasion group of the first PRS configuration of the assistance data reference cell at the target device antenna connector, N = 0 when the EARFCN of the neighbour cell is equal to that of the assistance data reference cell, and N = prs-SubframeOffset otherwise.

If PRS is not transmitted:

This field indicates the uncertainty in expectedRSTD value. The uncertainty is related to the location server's a‑priori estimation of the target device location. The expectedRSTD and expectedRSTD-Uncertainty together define the search window for the target device. The scale factor of the expectedRSTD-Uncertainty field is 3Ts, with Ts=1/(15000*2048) seconds.

If Tx is the reception time of the beginning of the subframe X of the assistance data reference cell at the target device antenna connector, the target device may assume that the beginning of the closest subframe of this neighbour cell to subframe X is received within the search window of size [ expectedRSTD-Uncertainty3Ts,  expectedRSTD-Uncertainty3Ts] centered at Tx + (expectedRSTD8192) 3Ts,
tpId
This field specifies an identity of the transmission point. This field together with the physCellId and/or prsID may be used to identify the transmission point in case the same physical cell ID is shared by multiple transmission points.
prs-only-tp
This field, if present, indicates that the OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoElement is provided for a PRS-only TP.

For the purpose of RSTD measurements from a PRS-only TP, the target device shall not assume any other signals or physical channels are present other than PRS [28].

For the purpose of RSTD measurements from a PRS-only TP, the target device shall use the physCellId only for PRS generation, and only if no PRS-ID is provided for this TP.
cpLengthCRS
This field specifies the cyclic prefix length of this assistance data neighbour cell CRS. If this field is present, the target device may assume the CRS and PRS antenna ports of this assistance data neighbour cell are quasi co-located (as defined in [16]).
sameMBSFNconfigNeighbour
This field indicates whether the MBSFN subframe configuration of the neighbour cell is the same as the current primary cell of the target device. TRUE means the same, and FALSE means not the same.
dlBandwidth
This field specifies the downlink bandwidth configuration of the neighbour cell, NRB in downlink, see TS 36.101 [21, table 5.6-1]. Enumerated value n6 corresponds to 6 resource blocks, n15 to 15 resource blocks and so on.
addPRSconfigNeighbour
This field specifies the additional (second and possibly third) PRS configuration(s) of the neighbour cell. When the EARFCN of the neighbour cell is the same as for the assistance data reference cell, the target device may assume that each PRS positioning occasion in each instance of addPRSconfigNeighbour in the neighbour cell at least partially overlaps with a PRS positioning occasion of the same instance of addPRSconfigRef in the assistance data reference cell where the maximum offset between the transmitted PRS positioning occasions may be assumed to not exceed half a subframe.
When the EARFCN of the neighbour cell is the same as for the assistance data reference cell, the target may assume that each instance of addPRSconfigNeighbour of this cell has the same PRS periodicity (TPRS) as the corresponding instance of addPRSconfigRef of the assistance data reference cell.

NOTE:	If this cell has more than one PRS configuration with equal longest PRS occasion group periodicity (i.e., PRS occasion group length times TPRS), the first such configuration is referenced. In order to avoid ambiguity for frequency hopping, a PRS occasion group should contain at least 2 PRS occasions with hopping between 2 narrowbands and at least 4 PRS occasions with hopping between 4 narrowbands.

PRS-Info-NB field descriptions
operationModeInfoNPRS
This field specifies the operation mode of the NPRS carrier. The value 'standalone' indicates standalone or guardband operation mode. 
nprs-carrier
This field specifies the NB-IoT carrier frequency for the NPRS. 
nprsSequenceInfo
This field specifies the index of the PRB containing the NPRS as defined in the table nprsSequenceInfo to E‑UTRA PRB index relation below.
nprsID
This field specifies the NPRS-ID as defined in [16]. 
subframePattern10, subframePattern40
This field specifies the NPRS subframe Part A configuration over 10ms or 40ms. Subframes not containing NPRS are indicated with value '0' in the bitmap; subframes containing NPRS are indicated with value '1' in the bitmap. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to the subframe #0 of the radio frame satisfying SFN mod x = 0, where x is the size of the bit string divided by 10. 
nprs-MutingInfoA
This field specifies the NPRS muting configuration of the NB-IoT carrier Part A configuration. The NPRS muting configuration is defined by a periodic NPRS muting sequence with periodicity TREP where TREP, counted in the number of NPRS positioning occasions, can be 2, 4, 8, or 16 which is also the length of the selected bit string that represents this NPRS muting sequence. If a bit in the NPRS muting sequence is set to '0', then the NPRS is muted in the corresponding NPRS positioning occasion. A NPRS positioning occasion for Part A comprises one radio frame (i.e., 10 subframes). The first/leftmost bit of the NPRS muting sequence corresponds to the first NPRS positioning occasion that starts after the beginning of the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell SFN=0. The sequence is valid for all subframes after the target device has received the nprs-MutingInfoA.
When the SFN of the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell is not known to the target device and nprs-MutingInfoA is provided for a cell in the OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoListNB IE, the target device may assume no NPRS is transmitted by that cell.
nprs-Period
This field specifies the NPRS occasion period TNPRS [16]. Enumerated values correspond to 160ms, 320ms, 640ms, and 1280ms. 
nprs-startSF
This field specifies the subframe offset  [16]. Enumerated values correspond to  of 0, 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, or 7/8.
nprs-NumSF
This field specifies the number of consecutive downlink subframes NNPRS in one NPRS positioning occasion [16]. Enumerated values correspond to 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, and 1280 subframes.

When the target device receives a nprs-NumSF which exceeds the nprs-Period (i.e., NNPRS > TNPRS), the target device may assume no NPRS is transmitted by that cell.
nprs-MutingInfoB
This field specifies the NPRS muting configuration of the NB-IoT carrier Part B configuration. The NPRS muting configuration is defined by a periodic NPRS muting sequence with periodicity TREP where TREP, counted in the number of NPRS positioning occasions, can be 2, 4, 8, or 16 which is also the length of the selected bit string that represents this NPRS muting sequence. If a bit in the NPRS muting sequence is set to '0', then the NPRS is muted in the corresponding NPRS positioning occasion. A NPRS positioning occasion for Part B comprises NNPRS consecutive downlink positioning subframes, where NNPRS is given by the nprs-NumSF field. The first/leftmost bit of the NPRS muting sequence corresponds to the first NPRS positioning occasion that starts after the beginning of the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell SFN=0. The sequence is valid for all subframes after the target device has received the nprs‑MutingInfoB.
When the SFN of the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell is not known to the UE and nprs-MutingInfoB is provided for a cell in the OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoListNB IE, the target device may assume no NPRS is transmitted by that cell.
When the UE receives a TREP-bit muting pattern together with a NPRS periodicity TNPRS for the same carrier which exceeds 10240 subframes (i.e., TREP × TNPRS > 10240 subframes), the target device shall assume an n-bit muting pattern based on the first n bits, where n = 10240/TNPRS.

This field specifies the narrowband physical cell identity of the NB-IoT neighbour cell, as defined in [12]. If this field is absent and if the OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList IE is included in OTDOA‑ProvideAssistanceData the narrowband physical layer cell identity is the same as the physCellId provided for the corresponding cell (as indicated by prsNeighbourCellIndex) in OTDOA‑NeighbourCellInfoList IE.
cellGlobalIdNB
This field specifies the global cell ID of the NB-IoT neighbour cell, as defined in [12]. If this field is absent and if the OTDOA‑NeighbourCellInfoList IE with cellGlobalId is included in OTDOA‑ProvideAssistanceData, the global cell identity of the NB-IoT neighbour cell is the same as provided for the corresponding cell (as indicated by prsNeighbourCellIndex) in OTDOA‑NeighbourCellInfoList IE.
carrierFreq
This field specifies the carrier frequency of the NB-IoT neighbour cell.
earfcn
This field specifies the EARFCN of the E-UTRAN frequency, in which the NB-IoT cell is deployed.
eutra-NumCRS-Ports
This field specifies whether 1 (or 2) antenna port(s) or 4 antenna ports for cell specific reference signals are used. 
otdoa-SIB1-NB-repetitions
This field specifies the repetition number of SIB1-NB of the neighbour cell. Enumerated values r4 correspond to 4 repetions, r8 to 8 repetitions, and r16 to 16 repetions.
Note, when NPRS configuration Part B only is configured on this NB-IoT neighbour cell (i.e., anchor carrier), nprs-NumSF does also count/include subframes containing NPSS, NSSS, NPBCH, or SIB1-NB, but the UE can assume that no NPRS are transmitted in these subframes [16].
nprsInfo
This field specifies the Type 1 NPRS [16] configuration of the NB-IoT neighbour cell.

When the carrier frequency of the NB-IoT neighbour cell is the same as for the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell, the target device may assume that each NPRS positioning occasion for each NPRS carrier frequency in the neighbour cell at least partially overlaps with a NPRS positioning occasion for each NPRS carrier frequency in the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell where the maximum offset between the transmitted NPRS positioning occasions may be assumed to not exceed half a subframe.
When the carrier frequency of the neighbour cell is the same as for the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell, and NPRS configuration Part B is configured, the target may assume that this cell has the same NPRS periodicity (TNPRS) as the assistance data reference cell for each NPRS carrier frequency.

When the target device receives this field with operationModeInfoNPRS set to value 'standalone', the target device shall assume no NPRS are transmitted on that NB-IoT carrier.
nprs-slotNumberOffset
This field specifies the slot number offset at the transmitter between this cell and the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell. The offset corresponds to the number of full slots counted from the beginning of a radio frame of the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell to the beginning of the closest subsequent radio frame of this cell. If this field is absent, the slot timing is the same as for the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell.
nprs-SFN-Offset
This field specifies the SFN offset (modulo 64) at the transmitter between this cell and the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell. The offset corresponds to the number of full radio frames counted from the beginning of a radio frame #0 of the NB‑IoT assistance data reference cell to the beginning of the closest subsequent radio frame #0 of this cell.
The UE may use this field together with the nprs-slotNumberOffset and otdoa-SIB1-NB-repetitions to determine the SIB1-NB subframes of this neighbour cell.
nprs-SubframeOffset
This field specifies the offset between the first NPRS subframe in the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell (NOTE 1) and the first NPRS subframe in the closest subsequent NPRS positioning occasion of the NPRS carrier with the longest NPRS periodicity of this cell (NOTE 2). The value is given in number of full sub-frames.  If this field is not present, the receiver shall consider the NPRS subframe offset to be 0.
expectedRSTD
This field indicates the RSTD value that the target device is expected to measure between this cell and the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell. The expectedRSTD field takes into account the expected propagation time difference as well as transmit time difference of NPRS positioning occasions between the two cells. The RSTD value can be negative and is calculated as (expectedRSTD-8192). The resolution is 3Ts, with Ts=1/(15000*2048) seconds.
If this field is absent and if the OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList IE is included in OTDOA‑ProvideAssistanceData, the expected RSTD is the same as provided in OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList IE for the corresponding cell (as indicated by prsNeighbourCellIndex).
expectedRSTD-Uncertainty
This field indicates the uncertainty in expectedRSTD value. The uncertainty is related to the location server's a‑priori estimation of the target device location. The expectedRSTD and expectedRSTD-Uncertainty together define the search window for the target device.
The scale factor of the expectedRSTD-Uncertainty field is 3Ts, with Ts=1/(15000*2048) seconds.
If this field is absent and if the OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList IE is included in OTDOA‑ProvideAssistanceData, the expected RSTD uncertainty is the same as provided in OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList IE for the corresponding cell (as indicated by prsNeighbourCellIndex).

The target device may assume that the beginning of the NPRS positioning occasion of the NPRS carrier with the longest NPRS periodicity of the neighbour cell (NOTE 2) is received within the search window of size [expectedRSTD-Uncertainty3Ts,  expectedRSTD-Uncertainty3Ts] centered at
TREF + 1 millisecondN + (expectedRSTD8192) 3Ts, where TREF is the reception time of the beginning of the NPRS positioning occasion of the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell (NOTE 1) at the target device antenna connector, and N = nprs‑SubframeOffset. 
prsNeighbourCellIndex
This field contains an index of the entry in IE OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList. Value 1 corresponds to the first cell in OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList, value 2 to the second, and so on. If this field is absent, and if the OTDOA‑NeighbourCellInfoList IE is included in OTDOA‑ProvideAssistanceData, it means there is no corresponding cell in OTDOA-NeighbourCellInfoList IE for this cell.
The target device may assume the antenna ports of the PRS of the cell indicated by prsNeighbourCellIndex and the NPRS of this cell are quasi co-located, as defined in [16].
nprsInfo-Type2
This field specifies the Type 2 NPRS [16] configuration of the NB-IoT neighbour cell. 

NOTE 1:	If the NB-IoT assistance data reference cell (i.e., anchor carrier) has no NPRS configured, the first NPRS carrier in PRS-Info-NB is referenced.
NOTE 2:	"Cell" in this context may not necessarily be the anchor carrier. If this "cell" has more than one NPRS carrier with equal longest periodicity, the first such NPRS carrier in PRS-Info-NB is referenced. The length of a NPRS positioning occasion for Part A in this context is the length of the nprsBitmap bit string.

6.5.2.2	GNSS Assistance Data Elements
–	GNSS-ReferenceTime
The IE GNSS-ReferenceTime is used by the location server to provide the GNSS specific system time with uncertainty and the relationship between GNSS system time and network air-interface timing of the eNodeB/NodeB/BTS transmission in the reference cell.
If the IE networkTime is present, the IEs gnss-SystemTime and networkTime provide a valid relationship between GNSS system time and air-interface network time, as seen at the approximate location of the target device, i.e. the propagation delay from the the eNodeB/NodeB/BTS to the target device shall be compensated for by the location server. Depending on implementation, the relation between GNSS system time and air-interface network time may have varying accuracy. The uncertainty of this timing relation is provided in the IE referenceTimeUnc. If the propagation delay from the eNodeB/NodeB/BTS to the target device is not accurately known, the location server shall use the best available approximation of the propagation delay and take the corresponding delay uncertainty into account in the calculation of the IE referenceTimeUnc.
If the IE networkTime is not present, the IE gnssSystemTime is an estimate of current GNSS system time at time of reception of the IE GNSS-ReferenceTime by the target device. The location server should achieve an accuracy of +/- 3 seconds for this estimate including allowing for the transmission delay between the location server and the target device. Note that the target device should further compensate gnss-SystemTime for the time between the reception of GNSS-ReferenceTime and the time when the gnss-SystemTime is used.
The location server shall provide a value for the gnss-TimeID only for GNSSs supported by the target device.
The IE GNSS-ReferenceTimeForOneCell can be provided multiple times (up to 16) to provide fine time assistance for several (neighbour) cells.

GNSS-ReferenceTime field descriptions
gnss-SystemTime
This field provides the specific GNSS system time.
networkTime
This field specifies the cellular network time at the epoch corresponding to gnss-SystemTime.
referenceTimeUnc
This field provides the accuracy of the relation between gnssSystemTime and networkTime time if IE networkTime is provided. When IE networkTime is not provided, this field can be included to provide the accuracy of the provided gnssSystemTime.
If GNSS TOD is the given GNSS time, then the true GNSS time, corresponding to the provided network time as observed at the target device location, lies in the interval [GNSS TOD - referenceTimeUnc, GNSS TOD + referenceTimeUnc].
The uncertainty r, expressed in microseconds, is mapped to a number K, with the following formula:
													r = C*(((1+x)K)-1)
with C = 0.5 and x = 0.14. To encode any higher value of uncertainty than that corresponding in the above formula to K=127, the same value, K=127, shall also be used. The uncertainty is then coded on 7 bits, as the binary encoding of K. Example values for the referenceTimeUnc Format: see table K to uncertainty relation below. 
bsAlign
This flag, if present, indicates that the transmission timings of all cells sharing, depending on the RAT, the same carrier frequency and Tracking Area/Location Area/Routing Area as the cell indicated, are frame aligned. This information allows the target device to derive the GNSS - cellular time relation for any of these cells based on the timing relation information provided in GNSS-ReferenceTime. The flag should be set consistently in all these cells. This flag does not guarantee SFN alignment.

                    604800 (WN - WNGGTO))2 )

where

tGNSS		is the system time of week for the GNSS indicated by gnss-TO-ID.
tE			is the system time of week for the GNSS indicated by GNSS-ID.
WN		is the week number of the GNSS system time indicated by GNSS-ID corresponding to the tE. 
tGGTO		is the system time of week for the time model data in the GNSS time indicated by GNSS-ID
			and given by the gnss‑TimeModelRefTime field.

GNSS-DifferentialCorrections field descriptions
dgnss-RefTime
This field specifies the time for which the DGNSS corrections are valid, modulo 1 hour. dgnss-RefTime is given in GNSS specific system time.
Scale factor 1‑second.
dgnss-SgnTypeList
This list includes differential correction data for different GNSS signal types, identified by GNSS-SignalID.
gnss-StatusHealth
This field specifies the status of the differential corrections. The values of this field and their respective meanings are defined as in table gnss-StatusHealth Value to Indication relation below.
The first six values in this field indicate valid differential corrections. When using the values described below, the "UDRE Scale Factor" value is applied to the UDRE values contained in the element. The purpose is to indicate an estimate in the amount of error in the corrections.
The value "110" indicates that the source of the differential corrections (e.g., reference station or external DGNSS network) is currently not being monitored. The value "111" indicates that the corrections provided by the source are invalid, as judged by the source. 
dgnss-SatList
This list includes differential correction data for different GNSS satellites, identified by SV-ID.
iod
This field specifies the Issue of Data field which contains the identity for the GNSS-NavigationModel.
udre
This field provides an estimate of the uncertainty (1-) in the corrections for the particular satellite. The value in this field shall be multiplied by the UDRE Scale Factor in the gnss-StatusHealth field to determine the final UDRE estimate for the particular satellite. The meanings of the values for this field are shown in the table udre Value to Indication relation below. 
pseudoRangeCor
This field specifies the correction to the pseudorange for the particular satellite at dgnss-RefTime, t0. The value of this field is given in meters and the scale factor is 0.32 meters in the range of ±655.04 meters. The method of calculating this field is described in [11].
If the location server has received a request for GNSS assistance data from a target device which included a request for the GNSS Navigation Model and DGNSS, the location server shall determine, for each satellite, if the navigation model stored by the target device is still suitable for use with DGNSS corrections and if so and if DGNSS corrections are supported the location server should send DGNSS corrections without including the GNSS Navigation Model.
The iod value sent for a satellite shall always be the IOD value that corresponds to the navigation model for which the pseudo-range corrections are applicable.
The target device shall only use the pseudoRangeCor value when the IOD value received matches its available navigation model.
Pseudo-range corrections are provided with respect to GNSS specific geodetic datum (e.g., PZ-90.02 if GNSS‑ID indicates GLONASS).
Scale factor 0.32 meters.
rangeRateCor
This field specifies the rate-of-change of the pseudorange correction for the particular satellite, using the satellite ephemeris and clock corrections identified by the iod field. The value of this field is given in meters per second and the resolution is 0.032 meters/sec in the range of ±4.064 meters/sec. For some time t1 > t0, the corrections for iod are estimated by
				PRC(t1, IOD) = PRC(t0, IOD) + RRC(t0,IOD)(t1 - t0)  ,
and the target device uses this to correct the pseudorange it measures at t1, PRm(t1,IOD), by
				PR(t1, IOD) = PRm(t1, IOD) + PRC(t1, IOD) .
The location server shall always send the RRC value that corresponds to the PRC value that it sends. The target device shall only use the RRC value when the iod value received matches its available navigation model.
Scale factor 0.032 meters/second.
udreGrowthRate
This field provides an estimate of the growth rate of uncertainty (1-) in the corrections for the particular satellite identified by SV-ID. The estimated UDRE at time value specified in the udreValidityTime t1 is calculated as follows:
				UDRE(t0+t1) = UDRE(t0)  udreGrowthRate ,
where t0 is the DGNSS Reference Time dgnss-RefTime for which the corrections are valid, t1 is the udreValidityTime
field, UDRE(t0) is the value of the udre field, and udreGrowthRate field is the factor as shown in the table Value of udreGrowthRate to Indication relation below.
udreValidityTime
This field specifies the time when the udreGrowthRate field applies and is included if udreGrowthRate is included. The meaning of the values for this field is as shown in the table Value of udreValidityTime to Indication relation below.

–	GNSS-NavigationModel
The IE GNSS-NavigationModel is used by the location server to provide precise navigation data to the GNSS capable target device. In response to a request from a target device for GNSS Assistance Data, the location server shall determine whether to send the navigation model for a particular satellite to a target device based upon factors like the T-Toe limit specified by the target device and any request from the target device for DGNSS (see also GNSS-DifferentialCorrections). GNSS Orbit Model can be given in Keplerian parameters or as state vector in Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed coordinates, dependent on the GNSS-ID and the target device capabilities. The meaning of these parameters is defined in relevant ICDs of the particular GNSS and GNSS specific interpretations apply. For example, GPS and QZSS use the same model parameters but some parameters have a different interpretation [7].

GNSS-AcquisitionAssistance field descriptions
gnss-SignalID
This field specifies the GNSS signal for which the acquisition assistance are provided.
gnss-AcquisitionAssistList
These fields provide a list of acquisition assistance data for each GNSS satellite.
confidence
This field specifies the confidence level of the reference location area or volume used to calculate the acquisition assistance parameters (search windows). A high percentage value (e.g., 98% or more) indicates to the target device that the provided search windows are reliable. The location server should include this field to indicate the confidence level of the provided information.
svID
This field specifies the GNSS SV‑ID of the satellite for which the GNSS-AcquisitionAssistance is given.
doppler0
This field specifies the Doppler (0th order term) value. A positive value in Doppler defines the increase in satellite signal frequency due to velocity towards the target device. A negative value in Doppler defines the decrease in satellite signal frequency due to velocity away from the target device. Doppler is given in unit of m/s by multiplying the Doppler value in Hz by the nominal wavelength of the assisted signal.
Scale factor 0.5 m/s in the range from -1024 m/s to +1023.5 m/s.
doppler1
This field specifies the Doppler (1st order term) value. A positive value defines the rate of increase in satellite signal frequency due to acceleration towards the target device. A negative value defines the rate of decrease in satellite signal frequency due to acceleration away from the target device.
Scale factor 1/210 m/s2 in the range from -0.2 m/s2 to +0.1 m/s2.
Actual value of Doppler (1st order term) is calculated as (-42 + doppler1) * 1/210 m/s2, with doppler1 in the range of 0…63.
dopplerUncertainty
This field specifies the Doppler uncertainty value. It is defined such that the Doppler experienced by a stationary target device is in the range [DopplerDoppler Uncertainty] to [DopplerDoppler Uncertainty]. Doppler Uncertainty is given in unit of m/s by multiplying the Doppler Uncertainty value in Hz by the nominal wavelength of the assisted signal.
Defined values: 2.5 m/s, 5 m/s, 10 m/s, 20 m/s, 40 m/s as encoded by an integer n in the range 0-4 according to:
												2-n(40) m/s; n = 0 – 4.
If the dopplerUncertaintyExt field is present, the target device that supports the dopplerUncertaintyExt shall ignore this field.
codePhase
This field together with the codePhase1023 field specifies the code phase, in units of milli‑seconds, in the range from 0 to 1 millisecond scaled by the nominal chipping rate of the GNSS signal, where increasing values of the field signify increasing predicted signal code phases, as seen by a receiver at the reference location at the reference time. The reference location would typically be an a priori estimate of the target device location.
Scale factor 2-10 ms in the range from 0 to (1-2-10) ms.
Note: The value (1-2-10) ms is encoded using the codePhase1023 IE.
intCodePhase
This field contains integer code phase (expressed modulo 128 ms). The satellite integer milli-seconds code phase currently being transmitted at the reference time, as seen by a receiver at the reference location is calculated as reference time (expressed in milli-seconds) minus (intCodePhase + (n×128 ms)), as shown in Figure 6.5.2.2-1, with n = …-2,-1,0,1,2….
Scale factor 1 ms in the range from 0 to 127 ms.
codePhaseSearchWindow
This field contains the code phase search window. The code phase search window accounts for the uncertainty in the estimated target device location but not any uncertainty in reference time. It is defined such that the expected code phase is in the range [Code PhaseCode Phase Search Window] to [Code PhaseCode Phase Search Window] given in units of milli‑seconds.
Range 0-31, mapping according to the table codePhaseSearchWindow Value to Interpretation Code Phase Search Window [ms] relation shown below.

This field specifies the elevation angle. An angle of y degrees means the satellite elevation e is in the range
(y  e < y+0.703125) degrees.
Scale factor 0.703125 degrees.
codePhase1023
This field if set to TRUE indicates that the code phase has the value 1023 × 2-10 = (1-2-10) ms. This field may only be set to TRUE if the value provided in the codePhase IE is 1022. If this field is set to FALSE, the code phase is the value provided in the codePhase IE in the range from 0 to (1 - 2×2-10) ms. If this field is not present and the codePhase IE has the value 1022, the target device may assume that the code phase is between (1 - 2×2-10) and (1 - 2-10) ms. 
dopplerUncertaintyExt
If this field is present, the target device that supports this field shall ignore the dopplerUncertainty field. The location server should include this field only if supported by the target device.
This field specifies the Doppler uncertainty value. It is defined such that the Doppler experienced by a stationary target device is in the range [DopplerDoppler Uncertainty] to [DopplerDoppler Uncertainty]. Doppler Uncertainty is given in unit of m/s by multiplying the Doppler Uncertainty value in Hz by the nominal wavelength of the assisted signal.
Enumerated values define 60 m/s, 80 m/s, 100 m/s, 120 ms, and "No Information".

–	GNSS-Almanac
The IE GNSS-Almanac is used by the location server to provide the coarse, long-term model of the satellite positions and clocks. The meaning of these parameters is defined in relevant ICDs of the particular GNSS and GNSS specific interpretations apply. For example, GPS and QZSS use the same model parameters but some parameters have a different interpretation [7]. GNSS-Almanac is useful for receiver tasks that require coarse accuracy, such as determining satellite visibility. The model is valid for up to a few weeks, typically. Since it is a long-term model, the field should be provided for all satellites available in the GNSS constellation (i.e., not only for SVs visible at the reference location and including SVs flagged as unhealthy in almanac). The completeAlmanacProvided field indicates whether or not the location server provided almanacs for the complete GNSS constellation.

MeasurementReferenceTime field descriptions
gnss-TOD-msec
This field specifies the GNSS TOD for which the measurements and/or location estimate are valid. The 22 bits of GNSS TOD are the least significant bits. The most significant bits shall be derived by the location server to unambiguously derive the GNSS TOD.
The value for GNSS TOD is derived from the GNSS specific system time indicated in gnss-TimeID rounded down to the nearest millisecond unit.
Scale factor 1 millisecond.
gnss-TOD-frac
This field specifies the fractional part of the GNSS TOD in 250 ns resolution. The total GNSS TOD is given by gnss-TOD-msec + gnss-TOD-frac.
Scale factor 250 nanoseconds.
gnss-TOD-unc
This field provides the accuracy of the relation GNSS-network time when GNSS-network time association is provided. When GNSS-network time association is not provided, this element can be included to provide the accuracy of the reported gnss-TOD-msec.
If GNSS TOD is the given GNSS time, then the true GNSS time, corresponding to the provided network time if applicable, as observed at the target device location, lies in the interval [GNSS TOD – gnss-TOD-unc, GNSS TOD + gnss-TOD-unc].
The uncertainty r, expressed in microseconds, is mapped to a number K, with the following formula:
												r = C*(((1+x)K)-1)
with C = 0.5 and x = 0.14. To encode any higher value of uncertainty than that corresponding in the above formula to K=127, the same value, K=127, shall also be used. The uncertainty is then coded on 7 bits, as the binary encoding of K. Examples of gnss-TOD-unc value are as in the table Value of K to Value of uncertainty relation below.
This field shall be included if the target device provides GNSS-network time relationship.
gnss-TimeID

This field identifies the reference cell for the GNSS-network time relation in GERAN, as defined in [14].
referenceFN, referenceFNMSB
These fields specify the frame number in GERAN which the GNSS time time stamps, as defined in [14]. The time of the reference frame boundary is as observed by the target device, i.e. without Timing Advance compensation. The referenceFNMSB field indicates the most significant bits of the frame number of the reference BTS corresponding to the GNSS-MeasurementList.  Starting from the complete GSM frame number denoted FN, the target device calculates Reference FN MSB as
									Reference FN MSB = floor(FN/42432)
The complete GSM frame number FN can then be reconstructed in the location server by combining the fields referenceFN with referenceFNMSB in the following way
								FN = referenceFNMSB *42432 + referenceFN
deltaGNSS-TOD
This field specifies the difference in milliseconds between gnss-TOD-msec reported and the milli-second part of the SV time tsv_1 of the first SV in the list reported from the target device, as defined in [14]. The deltaGNSS-TOD is defined as

This is represented by a bit string, with a one value at the bit position means periodicalReporting for the positioning mode is supported; a zero value means not supported. If this field is absent, the location server may assume that the target device does not support periodicalReporting in CommonIEsRequestLocationInformation.

6.5.7.5	Bluetooth Capability Information Request
–	BT-RequestCapabilities
The IE BT-RequestCapabilities is used by the location server to request Bluetooth positioning capabilities from a target device.
-- ASN1START

BT-RequestCapabilities-r13 ::= SEQUENCE {
	...
}

-- ASN1STOP

6.5.7.6	BT Error Elements
–	BT-Error
The IE BT-Error is used by the location server or target device to provide error reasons for Bluetooth positioning to the target device or location server, respectively.
-- ASN1START

BT-Error-r13 ::= CHOICE {
	locationServerErrorCauses-r13		BT-LocationServerErrorCauses-r13,
	targetDeviceErrorCauses-r13			BT-TargetDeviceErrorCauses-r13,

}

-- ASN1STOP

–	BT-LocationServerErrorCauses
The IE BT-LocationServerErrorCauses is used by the location server to provide error reasons for Bluetooth positioning to the target device.
-- ASN1START

BT-LocationServerErrorCauses-r13 ::= SEQUENCE {
	cause-r13								ENUMERATED	{undefined,	...},
	...
}

-- ASN1STOP

–	BT-TargetDeviceErrorCauses
The IE BT-TargetDeviceErrorCauses is used by the target device to provide error reasons for Bluetooth positioning to the location server.
-- ASN1START

BT-TargetDeviceErrorCauses-r13 ::= SEQUENCE {
	cause-r13								ENUMERATED {undefined,

-- ASN1STOP

BT-TargetDeviceErrorCauses field descriptions
cause
This field provides a Bluetooth specific error cause. If the cause value is 'notAllRequestedMeasurementsPossible', the target device was not able to provide all requested Bluetooth measurements (but may be able to provide some measurements). In this case, the target device should include bt-Beacon-rssiMeasurementNotPossible field.
