3	Definitions, Symbols and Abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions apply:
Elementary Procedure: RNSAP protocol consists of Elementary Procedures (Eps). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between two RNCs. An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of Eps are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success or failure);
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 Eps, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure has been successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
Class 2 Eps are considered always successful.
Prepared Reconfiguration: A Prepared Reconfiguration exists when the Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure has been completed successfully. The Prepared Reconfiguration does not exist anymore only after either of the procedures Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit or Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Cancellation has been completed. In particular, the Prepared Reconfiguration still exists if the object (e.g. Radio Link) concerned by the Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration (e.g. in the case of an HS-DSCH Setup) is removed, but the UE Context still exists.
UE Context: The UE Context contains the necessary information for the DRNC/DBSS to communicate with a specific UE. The UE Context is created by the Radio Link Setup procedure or by the Uplink Signalling Transfer procedure when the UE makes its first access in a cell controlled by the DRNS/DBSS or by Enhanced Relocation procedure when the procedure is the first dedicated RNSAP procedure for the UE. The UE Context is deleted by the Radio Link Deletion procedure, by the Common Transport Channel Resources Release procedure, or by the Downlink Signalling Transfer procedure when neither any Radio Links nor any common transport channels are established towards the concerned UE. The UE Context is identified by the SCCP Connection for messages using connection oriented mode of the signalling bearer and the D-RNTI for messages using connectionless mode of the signalling bearer, unless specified otherwise in the procedure text.
Distant RNC Context: The Distant RNC context is created by the first Common Measurement Initiation Procedure or Information Exchange Initiation Procedure initiated by one RNC/BSS and requested from another RNC/BSS. The Distant RNC Context is deleted after the Common Measurement Termination, the Common Measurement Failure, the Information Exchange Termination or the Information Exchange Failure procedure when there is no more Common Measurement and no more Information to be provided by the requested RNC/BSS to the requesting RNC/BSS. The Distant RNC Context is identified by a connection oriented signalling bearer (See TS 25.422 [68]) as, for common measurements and information exchange, only the connection oriented mode of the signalling bearer is used.
Signalling radio bearer 2: The signalling radio bearer 2 is used by the UE to access a GERAN cell in order to perform RRC procedures.

4	General
4.1	Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the DRNC/CRNC exactly and completely. The SRNC functional behaviour is left unspecified. The Physical Channel Reconfiguration procedure, [TDD – the UE Measurement Inititation, the UE Measurement Reporting, UE Measurement Termination, UE Measurement Failure,] and the Reset procedure are an exception from this principle.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in subclause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which “shall” be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node “shall” perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which “shall, if supported” be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node “shall, if supported,” perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements for including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see section 10. For examples on how to use the Criticality Diagnostics IE, see Annex C.
4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a mechanism in which all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Source Signalling Address Handling
The sender of an RNSAP messages shall include the Source Signalling Address, i.e. the Signalling Address of the sending node.
4.4	Specification Notations

5	RNSAP Services
5.1	RNSAP Procedure Modules
The Iur interface RNSAP procedures are divided into five modules as follows:
1.	RNSAP Basic Mobility Procedures;
2.	RNSAP Dedicated Procedures;
3.	RNSAP Common Transport Channel Procedures;
4.	RNSAP Global Procedures;
5.	RNSAP MBMS Procedures.
The Basic Mobility Procedures module contains procedures used to handle the mobility within UTRAN, within GERAN and between UTRAN and GERAN.
The Dedicated Procedures module contains procedures that are used to handle DCHs, [FDD – F-DPCH,] [TDD – DSCHs, USCHs], HS-DSCH and E-DCH between two RNSs. If procedures from this module are not used in a specific Iur, then the usage of DCH, [FDD – F-DPCH,] [TDD – DSCH, USCH,] HS-DSCH and E-DCH traffic between corresponding RNSs is not possible.
The Common Transport Channel Procedures module contains procedures that are used to control common transport channel data streams (excluding the DSCH, HS-DSCH and USCH) over Iur interface.
The Global Procedures module contains procedures that are not related to a specific UE. The procedures in this module are in contrast to the above modules involving two peer CRNCs/CBSSs.
The MBMS Procedures module contains procedures that are specific to MBMS and used for cases that cannot be handled by other modules.
5.2	Parallel Transactions
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any instance in time one protocol peer shall have a maximum of one ongoing RNSAP Dedicated procedure related to a certain UE.
6	Services Expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling transport shall provide two different service modes for the RNSAP.
1.	Connection oriented data transfer service. This service is supported by a signalling connection between two RNCs. It shall be possible to dynamically establish and release signalling connections based on the need. Each active UE shall have its own signalling connection. The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of RNSAP messages. RNSAP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.

8.2	Basic Mobility Procedures
8.2.1	Uplink Signalling Transfer
8.2.1.1	General
The procedure is used by the DRNC to forward a Uu message received on the CCCH to the SRNC.
This procedure shall use the connectionless mode of the signalling bearer.
8.2.1.2	Successful Operation

Figure 1: Uplink Signalling Transfer procedure, Successful Operation
When the DRNC receives an Uu message on the CCCH in which the UE addressing information is U-RNTI, i.e. S-RNTI and SRNC-ID, DRNC shall send the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message to the SRNC identified by the SRNC-ID received from the UE.
If at least one URA Identity is being broadcast in the cell where the Uu message was received (the accessed cell), the DRNC shall include a URA Identity for this cell in the URA ID IE, the Multiple URAs Indicator IE indicating whether or not multiple URA Identities are being broadcast in the accessed cell, and the RNC Identity of all other RNCs that are having at least one cell within the URA where the Uu message was received in the URA Information IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message.
The DRNC shall include in the message the C-RNTI that it allocates to identify the UE in the radio interface in the accessed cell. If there is no valid C-RNTI for the UE in the accessed cell, the DRNS shall allocate a new C-RNTI for the UE [FDD – and in case Enhanced FACH operation is activated in the accessed cell the DRNC shall allocate the HS-DSCH-RNTI to the UE and shall include the HS-DSCH-RNTI IE in the message. And in case Common E-DCH operation is activated in the accessed cell the DRNC shall include the E-RNTI received from Node B and shall include the E-RNTI IE in the message]. [1.28Mcps TDD – and in case Enhanced FACH operation is activated in the accessed cell the DRNC shall allocate the HS-DSCH-RNTI to the UE and shall include the HS-DSCH-RNTI IE in the message and the DRNC shall include the E-RNTI received from Node B and shall include the E-RNTI IE in the message]. If the DRNS allocates a new C-RNTI it shall also release any C-RNTI previously allocated for the UE.
If the DRNS has any RACH and/or FACH resources allocated for the UE identified by the U-RNTI in another cell than the accessed cell in which the Mac SDU sizes, flow control settings (including credits) and/or transport bearer are different from those in the old cell, then the DRNS shall not include the Common Transport Channel Resources Initialisation Not Required IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message. In addition the DRNS shall release these RACH and/or FACH resources in old cell.
If the DRNS has any RACH and/or FACH resources allocated for the UE identified by the U-RNTI in another cell than the accessed cell in which the Mac SDU sizes, flow control settings (including credits) and transport bearer are the same as in the old cell, there is no need for Common Transport Channel Resources Initialisation to be initiated. In that case, DRNC may include the Common Transport Channel Resources Initialisation Not Required IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message. In addition, the DRNS shall move these RACH and/or FACH resources to the new cell. If no Common Transfer Channel Resources Initialisation procedure is executed, the currently applicable Mac SDU sizes, flow control settings (including credits) and transport bearer shall continue to be used while the UE is in the new cell.
If no context exists for this UE in the DRNC, the DRNC shall create a UE Context for this UE, allocate a D-RNTI for the UE Context, and include the D-RNTI IE and the identifiers for the CN CS Domain and CN PS Domain that the DRNC is connected to in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message. These CN Domain Identifiers shall be based on the LAC and RAC respectively of the cell where the message was received from the UE.
Depending on local configuration in the DRNS, it may include the geographical co-ordinates of the cell, represented either by the Cell GAI IE or by the Cell GA Additional Shapes IE, in which the Uu message was received in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message. If the DRNC includes the Cell GA Additional Shapes IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message, it shall also include the Cell GAI IE.
[FDD – The DRNC shall include the DPC Mode Change Support Indicator IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message if the accessed cell supports DPC mode change.]
The DRNC shall include [FDD – the Cell Capability Container FDD IE] [3.84Mcps TDD – the Cell Capability Container TDD IE] [1.28Mcps TDD – the Cell Capability Container TDD LCR IE] [7.68Mcps TDD – the Cell Capability Container 7.68 Mcps TDD IE] [FDD – and/or the Cell Capability Container Extension FDD IE] in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message if the accessed cell supports any functionalities listed in [FDD – 9.2.2.D] [3.84Mcps TDD – 9.2.3.1a] [1.28Mcps TDD – 9.2.3.1b] [7.68Mcps TDD – 9.2.3.31] [FDD – 9.2.2.123]. 
[FDD – If the cell is multicell adjacent and/or non-adjacent carrier operation capable and if the cell can be the serving HS-DSCH then the possible cells to serve multicell adjacent and/or non-adjacent carrier operation (same or adjacent sector in the same Node B) that can act as secondary serving HS-DSCH shall be listed in the Secondary Serving Cell List IE. For each cell in the Secondary Serving Cell List IE that is Multi Cell E-DCH capable, indicated in the Cell Capability Container Extension FDD IE by the Multi Cell E-DCH Support Indicator bit = "1", and is restricted for use as an Additional E-DCH on the secondary uplink frequency with the accessed cell as the corresponding cell of the primary uplink frequency, the DRNS shall, if supported, include the Multicell E-DCH Restriction IE set to "TRUE". If the Secondary Serving Cell List IE is not present, the multicell (adjacent or non-adjacent carrier operation) capable cell can only serve as a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell in single band operation.]
[FDD – If the cell is HS-DSCH dual band capable and if the cell can be the serving HS-DSCH then the possible cells to serve dual band carrier operation (same sector) that can act as secondary serving HS-DSCH shall be listed in the Dual Band Secondary Serving Cell List IE. For each cell in the Dual Band Secondary Serving Cell List IE that is Dual Band E-DCH capable, indicated in the Cell Capability Container FDD IE by the "Dual Band E-DCH Support Indicator" bit = "1", and is restricted for use as an Additional E-DCH on the secondary uplink frequency with the accessed cell as the corresponding cell of the primary uplink frequency, the DRNS shall, if supported, include the Multicell E-DCH Restriction IE set to "TRUE". If the Dual Band Secondary Serving Cell List IE is not present, the dual band capable cell can only serve as a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell in dual band operation.]
If MOCN or GWCN network sharing configuration is used then the DRNC shall include the broadcasted PLMN identities of the concerned cell in the Multiple PLMN List IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message.
If available, the DRNC shall include the SNA Information IE for the concerned cell.
When receiving the SNA Information IE, the SRNC should use it to restrict cell access based on SNA information. See also TS 25.401 [40] for a broader description of the SNA access control.
[FDD – The DRNC shall include the Cell Portion ID IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message if available.] 
[1.28 Mcps TDD – The DRNC shall include the Cell Portion LCR ID IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message if available.]
[FDD – If the propagation delay value exceeds the range of the Propagation Delay IE then the DRNC shall if supported include the Extended Propagation Delay IE and set the Propagation Delay IE to its maximum value.]
If the D-RNTI IE is not to be included in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message and the UE Link is currently stored in the UE Context in the DRNC, the DRNC shall assume that the UE changes the cell under which it camps in the DRNS (see TS 25.346 [50], section 5.1.6 on intra-DRNC cell change). In this case, if an MBMS session for some MBMS bearer services contained in the UE Link is ongoing in the cell identified by the UC-ID IE, the DRNC shall include in the Active MBMS Bearer Service List IE the Transmission Mode IE for each of these active MBMS bearer services. Or else, if the DRNC receives a Uu message on the CCCH in which the short identities for MBMS Selected Services are included, and the Uu message requests for MBMS PtP radio bearer establishment, the DRNC shall determine which TMGIs correspond with the short identities and shall include in the Active MBMS Bearer Service List IE the TMGI IE together with the Transmission Mode IE for each of these MBMS Selected Services.
If the CCCH message contains Measurement results for monitored cells on non-used frequencies IE in Measured Result on RACH IE, the DRNC may include in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message the Inter-frequency Cell List IE for each of the measured inter-freqeuncy cells. The order of cells in Measurement results for monitored cells on non-used frequencies IE in the CCCH message shall be preserved in Inter-frequency Cell List IE. If the UL UARFCN IE in the Inter-frequency Cell List IE is not present, the default duplex distance defined for the operating frequency band shall be used in the SRNC (see TS 25.101 [43]).
[3.84 Mcps TDD – the DRNC shall include the Rx Timing Deviation IE unless the cell to which the CCCH message was sent is configured to use the extended timing advance in which case Rx Timing Deviation 3.84Mcps Extended IE shall be included.]
[7.68 Mcps TDD – the DRNC shall include the Rx Timing Deviation 7.68Mcps IE.]

The procedure consists of the DOWNLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER REQUEST message sent by the SRNC to the DRNC.
The message contains the Cell Identifier (C-ID) contained in the received UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message and the D-RNTI.
Upon receipt of the message, the DRNC shall send the L3 Information on the CCCH in the cell indicated by the C-ID IE to the UE identified by the D-RNTI IE.
If the D-RNTI Release Indication IE is set to “Release D-RNTI” and the DRNS has no dedicated resources (DCH, [TDD – USCH and/or DSCH]) allocated for the UE, the DRNS shall release the D-RNTI, the UE Context and any RACH and FACH resources and any C-RNTI allocated to the UE Context upon receipt of the DOWNLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER REQUEST message. If a UE Link is currently stored in the UE Context, the DRNC shall perform UE De-linking as specified in TS 25.346 [50], section 5.1.6.
If the D-RNTI Release Indication IE is set to “Release D-RNTI” and the DRNS has dedicated resources allocated for the UE, the DRNS shall only release any RACH and FACH resources and any C-RNTI allocated to the UE Context upon receipt of the DOWNLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER REQUEST message.

The connection-oriented service of the signalling bearer shall be established in conjunction with this procedure.
8.3.1.2	Successful Operation

Figure 5: Radio Link Setup procedure: Successful Operation
When the SRNC makes an algorithmic decision to add the first cell or set of cells from a DRNS to the active set of a specific UE-UTRAN connection, the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message is sent to the corresponding DRNC to request establishment of the radio link(s). The Radio Link Setup procedure is initiated with this RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message sent from the SRNC to the DRNC.
Upon receipt of the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message, the DRNS shall reserve the necessary resources and configure the new RL(s) according to the parameters given in the message. Unless specified below, the meaning of parameters is specified in other specifications.
The DRNS shall prioritise resource allocation for the RL(s) to be established according to Annex A.
If the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message includes the Allowed Queuing Time IE the DRNS may queue the request for a time period not to exceed the value of the Allowed Queuing Time IE before starting to execute the request.
If the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is contained in the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message, the DRNS shall, if supported, store the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate data rate of non GBR traffic for this UE.
If the Usefulness of Battery Optimization IE is contained in the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message, the DRNC may store the received value and use it to determine whether this UE can benefit from battery optimization techniques.
If the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message includes the Selected PLMN Identity IE, the DRNS should use this information to determine if it can set up a Radio Link for the corresponding UE.
Transport Channels Handling:
DCH(s):
[TDD – If the DCH Information IE is present in the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message, the DRNS shall configure the new DCHs according to the parameters given in the message.]
If the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message includes a DCH Information IE with multiple DCH Specific Info IEs, then the DRNS shall treat the DCHs in the DCH Information IE as a set of co-ordinated DCHs.
If the DCH Specific Info IE includes the Unidirectional DCH Indicator IE set to “Uplink DCH only”, the DRNS shall ignore the Transport Format Set IE for the downlink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the downlink CCTrCH.
If the DCH Specific Info IE includes the Unidirectional DCH Indicator IE set to “Downlink DCH only”, the DRNS shall ignore the Transport Format Set IE for the uplink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the uplink CCTrCH.
[FDD – For each DCH which do not belong to a set of co-ordinated DCHs, and which includes a QE-Selector IE set to “selected”, the DRNS shall use the Transport channel BER from that DCH for the QE in the UL data frames. If no Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH, the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER for the QE, TS 25.427 [4]. If the QE-Selector IE is set to “non-selected”, the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER for the QE in the UL data frames, TS 25.427 [4].]
For a set of co-ordinated DCHs, the DRNS shall use the Transport channel BER from the DCH with the QE-Selector IE set to “selected” for the QE in the UL data frames, TS 25.427 [4]. [FDD – If no Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH, the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER for the QE, TS 25.427 [4].

The DRNS shall use the included ToAWS IE for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs as the Time of Arrival Window Startpoint in the user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs.
The DRNS shall use the included ToAWE IE for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs as the Time of Arrival Window Endpoint in the user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs.
The Frame Handling Priority IE defines the priority level that should be used by the DRNS to prioritise between different frames of the data frames of the DCHs in the downlink on the radio interface in congestion situations once the new RL(s) have been activated.
The Traffic Class IE may be used to determine the transport bearer characteristics to apply between DRNC and Node B for the related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs. The DRNC should ignore the Traffic Class IE if the TrCH Source Statistics Descriptor IE indicates the value “RRC”.
If the TNL QoS IE is included for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs and if ALCAP is not used, the TNL QoS IE may be used by the DRNS to determine the transport bearer characteristics to apply in the uplink for the related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs.

If the DCH Specific Info IE in the DCH Information IE does not include the Guaranteed UL Rate IE, the DRNS shall not limit the user rate of the uplink of the DCH.
-	If the Guaranteed Rate Information IE includes the Guaranteed DL Rate IE, the DRNS shall apply the Guaranteed Rate in the downlink of this DCH.

8.3.5	Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit
8.3.5.1	General
This procedure is used to order the DRNS to switch to the new configuration for the Radio Link(s) within the DRNS, previously prepared by the Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure.
When Mode 1 is used for the fast TTI switching, the procedure shall if supported be used to order the DRNS to execute the TTI switching process.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE Context.
8.3.5.2	Successful Operation

Figure 12: Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit procedure, Successful Operation
[FDD - If the Activation Delay IE is included in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message, the DRNS shall if supported send the HS-SCCH order to execute the TTI switching process according to TS 25.214 [10]. The CFN IE in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message shall be ignored by the DRNS.]
The DRNS shall switch to the new configuration previously prepared by the Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure at the “configuration switching point” occurring:
-	[TDD – at the next coming CFN with a value equal to the value requested by the SRNC in the CFN IE (see TS 25.402 [17] subclause 9.4) when receiving the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message from the SRNC.]
-	[FDD – if the Fast Reconfiguration Mode IE is not included in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message at the next coming CFN with a value equal to the value requested by the SRNC in the CFN IE (see TS 25.402 [17] subclause 9.4) when receiving the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message from the SRNC.]
-	[FDD – if the Fast Reconfiguration Mode IE is included in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message as soon as the DRNS detects that the UE uses the new configuration in the uplink (e.g. the Node B indicates that the UE uses the new scrambling code used for the uplink by sending the RADIO LINK RESTORATION message). In order to limit the period for the detection in the DRNS the CFN in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message indicates the earliest possible time instant at which the UE might use the new configuration.]
[FDD – If the Active Pattern Sequence Information IE is included in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message, the CM Configuration Change CFN IE in the Active Pattern Sequence Information IE shall be ignored by the DRNS.]
[FDD – If the Active Pattern Sequence Information IE is not included in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message and a new Compressed Mode Configuration exists in the prepared configuration, the DRNS shall behave as if an Active Pattern Sequence Information IE with an empty Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence Status IE was included.]
When this procedure has been completed the Prepared Reconfiguration does not exist any more, see subclause 3.1.
In the case of a Transport Channel or MAC-d flow modification for which a new transport bearer was requested and established, the switch to the new transport bearer shall also take place at the configuration switching point (defined above) indicated CFN.
The detailed frame protocol handling during transport bearer replacement is described in TS 25.427 [4], subclause 5.10.1, and in TS 25.425 [32], subclauses 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.
[FDD – If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT includes the Active Pattern Sequence Information IE, the DRNS shall deactivate all the ongoing Transmission Gap Pattern Sequences at the configuration switching point (defined above). From that moment on all Transmission Gap Pattern Sequences included in Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence Status IE repetitions shall be started when the indicated TGCFN IE elapses. The CFN IE and TGCFN IE for each sequence refer to the next coming CFN with that value. If the values of the CFN IE and the TGCFN IE are equal, the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be started immediately at the CFN with a value equal to the value received in the CFN IE.]
[FDD – If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message includes the Active Pattern Sequence Information IE and the concerned UE Context is configured to use F-DPCH in the downlink, the DRNS shall ignore, when activating the Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence(s), the downlink compressed mode method information, if existing, for the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence(s) in the Compressed Mode Configuration.]
[FDD - If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message includes the Affected HS-DSCH serving cell List IE in the Active Pattern Sequence Information IE, the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be applied to HS-DSCH serving cells associated with C-ID IE included in Affected HS-DSCH serving cell List IE. Otherwise the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be applied to all the configured serving cells.]

When applicable, the allocation retention priorities associated with the transport channels shall be used by the DRNS to prioritise which Radio Links to indicate as unavailable to the SRNC.
Typical cause values are:
Radio Network Layer Causes:
Synchronisation Failure;
Invalid CM Settings.
Transport Layer Causes:

If the Report Characteristics IE is set to “Event D”, the DRNS shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity falls more than the requested threshold specified by the Measurement Increase/Decrease Threshold IE, and only when this falls occurs within the requested falling time specified by the Measurement Change Time IE. After reporting this type of event, the DRNS shall not initiate the next D event reporting for the same measurement during the subsequent time specified by the Measurement Change Time IE.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to “Event E”, the DRNS shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity rises above the Measurement Threshold 1 IE and stays above the threshold for the Measurement Hysteresis Time IE (Report A). When the conditions for Report A are met and if the Report Periodicity IE is provided, the DRNS shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure periodically with the requested report frequency specified by the Report Periodicity IE. If the conditions for Report A have been met and the measured entity falls below the Measurement Threshold 2 IE and stays below the threshold for the Measurement Hysteresis Time IE, the DRNS shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) and shall terminate any corresponding periodic reporting. If the Measurement Threshold 2 IE is not present, the DRNS shall use the value of the Measurement Threshold 1 IE instead. If the Measurement Hysteresis Time IE is not included, the DRNC shall use the value zero as hysteresis times for both Report A and Report B.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to “Event F”, the DRNS shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity falls below the Measurement Threshold 1 IE and stays below the threshold for the Measurement Hysteresis Time IE (Report A). When the conditions for Report A are met and if the Report Periodicity IE is provided, the DRNS shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure periodically with the requested report frequency specified by the Report Periodicity IE. If the conditions for Report A have been met and the measured entity rises above the Measurement Threshold 2 IE and stays above the threshold for the Measurement Hysteresis Time IE, the DRNS shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) and shall terminate any corresponding periodic reporting. If the Measurement Threshold 2 IE is not present, the DRNS shall use the value of the Measurement Threshold 1 IE instead. If the Measurement Hysteresis Time IE is not included, the DRNC shall use the value zero as hysteresis times for both Report A and Report B.
If the Report Characteristics IE is not set to “On –Demand”, the DRNS is required to perform reporting for a dedicated measurement object, in accordance with the conditions provided in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, as long as the object exists. If no dedicated measurement object(s) for which a measurement is defined exists any more, the DRNS shall terminate the measurement locally without reporting this to the SRNC.
If at the start of the measurement, the reporting criteria are fulfilled for any of Event A, Event B, Event E or Event F, the DRNS shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure immediately, and then continue with the measurements as specified in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message.
Higher layer filtering
The Measurement Filter Coefficient IE indicates how filtering of the dedicated measurement values shall be performed before measurement event evaluation and reporting.
The averaging shall be performed according to the following formula.

The variables in the formula are defined as follows:
Fn is the updated filtered measurement result.
Fn-1 is the old filtered measurement result.
Mn is the latest received measurement result from physical layer measurements, the unit used for Mn is the same unit as the reported unit in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE, DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT messages or the unit used in the event evaluation (i.e. same unit as for Fn).
A = ½(k/2) , where k is the parameter received in the Measurement Filter Coefficient IE. If the Measurement Filter Coefficient IE is not present, a shall be set to 1 (no filtering) 
In order to initialise the averaging filter, F0 is set to M1 when the first measurement result from the physical layer measurement is received.
Measurement Recovery Behavior:
If the Measurement Recovery Behavior IE is included in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the DRNS shall, if Measurement Recovery Behavior is supported, include the Measurement Recovery Support Indicator IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message and perform the Measurement Recovery Behavior as described in subclause 8.3.12.2.
Response message
If the DRNS was able to initiate the measurement requested by the SRNS it shall respond with the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message. The message shall include the same Measurement ID that was used in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message.
In the case in which the Report Characteristics IE is set to “On Demand”:
-	The DRNC shall include the measurement result in the Dedicated Measurement Value IE within the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.
-	If the CFN Reporting Indicator IE is set to “FN Reporting Required”, the CFN IE shall be included in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message. The reported CFN shall be the CFN at the time when the dedicated measurement value was reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement model (TS 25.302 [26]).

8.3.15.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to balance the DL transmission powers of one or more radio links for one UE.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE Context.
The Downlink Power Control procedure may be initiated by the SRNC at any time after establishing a Radio Link. If the SRNC has initiated in this DRNS the deletion of the last Radio Link for this UE context, the Downlink Power Control procedure shall not be initiated.
8.3.15.2	Successful Operation

Figure 25: Downlink Power Control procedure, Successful Operation
The Downlink Power Control procedure is initiated by the SRNC sending a DL POWER CONTROL REQUEST message to the DRNC.
The Power Adjustment Type IE defines the characteristic of the power adjustment.
If the value of the Power Adjustment Type IE is “Common”, the DRNS shall set the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the UE Context set to “Common”. As long as the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the UE Context is set to “Common”, the DRNS shall perform the power adjustment (see below) for all existing and future radio links for the UE Context and use a common DL reference power level.
If the value of the Power Adjustment Type IE is “Individual”, the DRNS shall set the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the UE Context set to “Individual”. The DRNS shall perform the power adjustment (see below) for all radio links addressed in the message using the given DL Reference Power per RL. If the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the UE Context was set to “Common” before this message was received, power balancing on all radio links not addressed by the DL POWER CONTROL REQUEST message shall remain to be executed in accordance with the existing power balancing parameters which are now considered RL individual parameters. Power balancing will not be started on future radio links without a specific request.
If the value of the Power Adjustment Type IE is “None”, the DRNS shall set the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the UE Context set to “None” and the DRNS shall suspend on going power adjustments for all radio links for the UE Context.
If the Inner Loop DL PC Status IE is present and set to “Active”, the DRNS shall activate inner loop DL power control for all radio links for the UE Context. If the Inner Loop DL PC Status IE is present and set to “Inactive”, the DRNS shall deactivate inner loop DL power control for all radio links for the UE Context according to TS 25.214 [10].
Power Adjustment
The power balancing adjustment shall be superimposed on the inner loop power control adjustment (see TS 25.214 [10]) if activated. The power balancing adjustment shall be such that:
with an accuracy of ±0.5 dB
where the sum is performed over an adjustment period corresponding to a number of frames equal to the value of the Adjustment Period IE, Pref is the value of the DL Reference Power IE, PP-CPICH is the power used on the primary CPICH, Pinit is the code power of the last slot of the previous adjustment period and r is given by the Adjustment Ratio IE. If the last slot of the previous adjustment period is within a transmission gap due to compressed mode, Pinit shall be set to the same value as the code power of the slot just before the transmission gap.
The adjustment within one adjustment period shall in any case be performed with the constraints given by the Max Adjustment Step IE and the DL TX power range set by the DRNC.
The power adjustments shall be started at the first slot of a frame with CFN modulo the value of Adjustment Period IE equal to 0 and shall be repeated for every adjustment period and shall be restarted at the first slot of a frame with CFN=0, until a new DL POWER CONTROL REQUEST message is received or the RL is deleted.

From that moment on all Transmission Gap Pattern Sequences included in Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence Status IE repetitions (if present) shall be started when the indicated TGCFN IE elapses. The CM Configuration Change CFN IE in the Active Pattern Sequence Information IE and TGCFN IE for each sequence refer to the next coming CFN with that value.
If the values of the CM Configuration Change CFN IE and the TGCFN IE are equal, the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be started immediately at the CFN with a value equal to the value received in the CM Configuration Change CFN IE.
If the Affected HS-DSCH serving cell List IE is included, the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be applied to HS-DSCH serving cells associated with C-ID IE included in Affected HS-DSCH serving cell List IE. Otherwise the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be applied to all the configured serving cells.
If the concerned UE Context is configured to use F-DPCH in the downlink, the DRNS shall ignore, when activating the Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence(s), the downlink compressed mode method information, if existing, for the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence(s) in the Compressed Mode Configuration.
8.3.16.3	Abnormal Conditions
[FDD - If the Affected HS-DSCH serving cell List IE is included in the Active Pattern Sequence Information IE, and theTransmission Gap Pattern Sequence for affected HS-DSCH Serving Cells is activated on the HS-DSCH Primary Serving Cell but not for all the other serving cells, the DRNS shall initiate the Radio Link Failure procedure with the cause value “Invalid CM Settings”.]

Start of an UL/DL Resource Congestion Situation
When the DRNC detects the start of a UL/DL resource congestion situation and prefers the rate of one or more DCHs for one or more Radio Link(s) to be limited below the maximum rate currently configured in the UL/DL TFS, it shall send the RADIO LINK CONGESTION INDICATION message to the SRNC. The DRNC shall indicate the cause of the congestion in the Congestion Cause IE and shall indicate all the Radio Links for which the rate of a DCH needs to be reduced. For each DCH within the RL with UL congestion, the DRNC shall indicate the desired maximum UL data rate with the Allowed UL Rate IE in the Allowed Rate Information IE. For each DCH within the RL with DL congestion, the DRNC shall indicate the desired maximum DL data rate with the Allowed DL Rate IE in the Allowed Rate Information IE.
[FDD – For each E-DCH MAC-d flow within the RL with UL congestion, the DRNC shall indicate all the MAC-d flows for which the rate cannot be fullfilled.]
When receiving the RADIO LINK CONGESTION INDICATION message the SRNC should reduce the rate in accordance with the Congestion Cause IE and the indicated Allowed DL Rate IE and/or Allowed UL Rate IE for a DCH.
[FDD – If the RADIO LINK CONGESTION INDICATION message includes the DCH Indicator For E-DCH-HSDPA Operation IE, then the SRNS shall ignore the DCH Rate Information IE in the RADIO LINK CONGESTION INDICATION message.]
Change of UL/DL Resource Congestion Situation
The DRNC shall indicate any change of the UL/DL resource congestion situation by sending the RADIO LINK CONGESTION INDICATION message in which the new allowed rate(s) of the DCHs are indicated by the Allowed Rate Information IE.

Figure 30: Error Indication procedure, Successful Operation
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving node. This message shall use the same mode of the signalling bearer and the same signalling bearer connection (if connection oriented) as the message that triggers the procedure.
When the ERROR INDICATION message is sent from a DRNC to an SRNC using connectionless mode of the signalling bearer, the S-RNTI IE shall be included in the message if the UE Context addressed by the D-RNTI IE which was received in the message triggering the Error Indication procedure exists. When the ERROR INDICATION message is sent from an SRNC to a DRNC using connectionless mode of the signalling bearer, the D-RNTI IE shall be included in the message if available.
When a message using connectionless mode of the signalling bearer is received in the DRNC and there is no UE Context in the DRNC as indicated by the D-RNTI IE, the DRNC shall include the D-RNTI from the received message in the D-RNTI IE and set the Cause IE to “Unknown RNTI” in the ERROR INDICATION message, unless another handling is specified in the procedure text for the affected procedure.
When a message using connectionless mode of the signalling bearer is received in the SRNC and there is no UE in the SRNC as indicated by the S-RNTI IE, the SRNC shall include the S-RNTI from the received message in the S-RNTI IE and set the Cause IE to “Unknown RNTI” in the ERROR INDICATION message, unless another handling is specified in the procedure text for the affected procedure.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall include either the Cause IE, or the Criticality Diagnostics IE, or both the Cause IE and the Criticality Diagnostics IE to indicate the reason for the error indication.
Typical cause values for the ERROR INDICATION message are:
Protocol Causes:
-	Transfer Syntax Error;
-	Abstract Syntax Error (Reject);
-	Abstract Syntax Error (Ignore and Notify);
-	Message not Compatible with Receiver State;
-	Unspecified.

If the SFN IE is provided, it indicates the frame for which the measurement value shall be provided. The provided measurement value shall be the one reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement model (TS 25.302 [26]).

BIT STRING (SIZE(7))
1.28 Mcps TDD only.
The absence of this IE means that the specific timeslot(s) of the non-rectangular resource is defined in [34].
This IE indicats which of the timeslot(s) is/are allocated for non-rectangular resource. 
Bit 0 is for timeslot 0. Bit 1 is for timeslot 1. Bit 2 is for timeslot 2. Bit 3 is for timeslot 3. Bit 4 is for timeslot 4. Bit 5 is for timeslot 5. Bit 6 is for timeslot 6.
The value 0 of a bit means the corresponding timeslot is not allocated for non-rectangular resource. The value 1 of a bit means the corresponding timeslot is allocated for non-rectangular resource.
Bit 0 is the first/leftmost bit of the bit string.

9.2	Information Element Functional Definition and Contents
9.2.0	General
Subclause 9.2 presents the RNSAP IE definitions in tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.3. In case there is a contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;
9.2.1	Common Parameters
This subclause contains parameters that are common to FDD and TDD.
9.2.1.1	Allocation/Retention Priority
This parameter indicates the priority level in the allocation and retention of transport channel resources in DRNS. DRNS may use the Allocation/Retention priority information of the transport channels composing the RL to prioritise requests for RL Setup/addition and reconfiguration. In similar way, DRNS may use the allocation/Retention priority information of the transport channels composing the RL to prioritise which RL shall be set to failure, in case prioritisation is possible. See Annex A.

INTEGER(0..15)
This IE indicates the priority of the request.
Usage:
Value “0” means “Spare”; It shall be treated as a logical error if received.
Values between 1 and 14 are ordered in decreasing order of priority, “1” being the highest and “14” the lowest.
Value “15” means “No Priority”.
Pre-emption Capability
M

ENUMERATED(shall not trigger pre-emption, may trigger pre-emption)

Pre-emption Vulnerability

The cell capability of multi-cell related functions may depend on that the cell is multi-cell capable (adjacent and/or non-adjacent carrier) or Dual Band capable. Such support indicators in this Cell Capability Container Extension FDD IE shall be ignored by the SRNC if the cell does not have the required support indicated in the Cell Capability Container FDD IE: Multi Cell Support Indicator = "1" and/or Dual Band Support Indicator = "1". Support indicators that depend on multi-cell (adjacent and/or non-adjacent carrier) support are indicated in the table below with /Adjacent-carrier/. Support indicators that depend on Dual Band support are indicated in the table below with /Dual-band/. Support indicators that depend on that the cell supports one or both of multi-cell (adjacent and/or non-adjacent carrier) and Dual Band are indicated in the table below with /Multi-cell/. The marked support indicators indicate the support regardless of the supported multi-cell type in a multicell configuration: supported multi-cell type is - both serving HS-DSCH and secondary serving HS-DSCH, - secondary serving HS-DSCH or - serving HS-DSCH.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.0	General
RNSAP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.680 [18] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [19].
Subclause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of RNSAP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this subclause and the tabular format in subclause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of RNSAP messages. RNSAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct a RNSAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value “mandatory”. An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value “optional” or “conditional”. If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE: In the above “IE” means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE IDs.
If a RNSAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
9.3.1	Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor inter-operability.
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.

9.4	Message Transfer Syntax
RNSAP shall use the ASN.1 Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER) Aligned Variant as transfer syntax as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [20].
9.5	Timers
T Preempt
-	Specifies the maximum time that a DRNS may wait for pre-emption of resources for establishment or reconfiguration of Radio Links.
TRELOCprep
-	Specifies the maximum time for the Enhanced Relocation procedure in the SRNC.
10	Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
10.1	General
Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:
1.	Transfer Syntax Error;
2.	Abstract Syntax Error;
3.	Logical Error.
Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving node.

Figure 34: Protocol Errors in RNSAP
The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included in the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be included. Other optional information elements within the message may also be included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the reporting is done with a response message. The latter is an exception to what is stated in subclause 4.1.
10.2	Transfer Syntax Error
A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode the received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always detected in the process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error occurs, the receiver should initiate Error Indication procedure with appropriate cause value for the Transfer Syntax protocol error.
Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:
-	Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. E.g.: If an IE has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and 12 will be received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax error;
-	Violation in list element constraints. E.g.: If a list is defined as containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, than this case will be handled as a transfer syntax error;
-	Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the originator of the message);
-	Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the originator of the message).
10.3	Abstract Syntax Error
10.3.1	General
An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional RNSAP entity:
1.	Receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE id);
2	Receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g.: ASN.1 definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10 (values 11 to 15 are undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an abstract syntax error using criticality information sent by the originator of the message);
3	Does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence of the concerned object, the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the received message;
4	Receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group;
5	receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the concerned object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE groups should not have been present in the received message.
Cases 1 and 2 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on received Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is handled based on Criticality information and Presence information for the missing IE/IE group specified in the version of the specification used by the receiver. Case 4 (IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences) and Case 5 (erroneously present conditional IEs or IE groups) result in rejecting the procedure.
If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the remaining message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error that belong to cases 1-3 act according to the Criticality Information and Presence Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract Syntax Error occurred in accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is specified in subclause 10.3.6.
10.3.2	Criticality Information
In the RNSAP messages there is criticality information set for individual IEs and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver how to act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended, i.e. the entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully or partially) comprehended shall be treated in accordance with its own criticality information as specified in subclause 10.3.4.
In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing IE/IE group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).
The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the Criticality Information. The three possible values of the Criticality Information for an IE/IE group are:
1.	Reject IE;
2.	Ignore IE and Notify Sender;
3.	Ignore IE.
The following rules restrict when a receiving entity may consider an IE, an IE group or an EP not comprehended (not implemented), and when action based on criticality information is applicable:
1.	IE or IE group: When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, then other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered comprehended by a receiving entity (some may still remain unsupported).
2.	EP: The comprehension of different Eps within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not supported may be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from that standard version is comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.
10.3.3	Presence Information
For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1 transfer syntax, RNSAP specifies separately if the presence of these IEs/IE groups is optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application by means of the presence field f the concerned object of class RNSAP-PROTOCOL-IES, RNSAP-PROTOCOL-IES-PAIR, RNSAP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or RNSAP-PRIVATE-IES.
The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:
1.	Optional;
2.	Conditional;
3.	Mandatory.
If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence of the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the condition is true according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE group.
If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of the IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE group.
10.3.4	Not Comprehended IE/IE Group
10.3.4.1	Procedure ID
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality information of the Procedure ID according to the following:
Reject IE:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure ID marked with “Reject IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall reject the procedure using the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure ID marked with “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure ID marked with “Ignore IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the procedure.
When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to report an ignored procedure it shall include the Procedure ID IE, the Triggering Message IE, and the Procedure Criticality IE in the Criticality Diagnostics IE.
10.3.4.1A	Type of Message
When the receiving node cannot decode the Type of Message IE, the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
10.3.4.2	IEs Other Than the Procedure ID and Type of Message
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality information of an IE/IE group other than the Procedure ID IE and Type of Message IE according to the following:
Reject IE:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Reject IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the rejection of one or more IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Reject IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Reject IE, that the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Ignore IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Ignore IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with “Reject IE” or “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” using a response message defined for the procedure, the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. In the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE the Repetition Number IE shall be included and in addition, if the not comprehended IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the Message Structure IE shall be included.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with “Reject IE” or “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” using the Error Indication procedure, the Procedure ID IE, the Triggering Message IE, Procedure Criticality IE, the Transaction ID IE, and the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. In the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE the Repetition Number IE shall be included and in addition, if the not comprehended IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the Message Structure IE shall be included.
10.3.5	Missing IE or IE Group
The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received message specified in the version of this specification used by the receiver:
Reject IE:
-	If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Reject IE”; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a received message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Reject IE”, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Reject IE, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Ignore IE and Notify Sender”, the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a received message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Ignore IE and Notify Sender”, the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
-	If a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Ignore IE and Notify Sender”, the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
Ignore IE:
-	If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Ignore IE”, the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
-	If a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Ignore IE”, the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Reject IE” or “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” using a response message defined for the procedure, the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. In the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE the Repetition Number IE shall be included and in addition, if the missing IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the Message Structure IE shall be included.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Reject IE” or “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” using the Error Indication procedure, the Procedure ID IE, the Triggering Message IE, Procedure Criticality IE, the Transaction ID IE, and the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. In the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE the Repetition Number IE shall be included and in addition, if the missing IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the Message Structure IE shall be included.
10.3.6	IEs or IE Groups Received in Wrong Order or With Too Many Occurrences or Erroneously Present
If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional presence are present when the condition is not met (i.e. erroneously present), the receiving node shall behave according to the following:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value “Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)” using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure, and use cause value “Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)”.
-	If a response message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the specification version used by the receiver shall be considered.
10.4	Logical Error
Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly, but the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e. semantic error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with the state of the receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour shall be performed (unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class of the elementary procedure, irrespective of the criticality information of the IEs/IE groups containing the erroneous values.
Class 1:
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1 procedure, and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. Typical cause values are:
Protocol Causes:
1.	Semantic Error;
2.	Message not Compatible with Receiver State.
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1 procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure ID IE, the Triggering Message IE and the Transaction ID IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
Class 2:
Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure ID IE, the Triggering Message IE and the Transaction ID IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
10.5	Exceptions
The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take precedence over any other error handling described in the other subclauses of clause 10.
-	If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local error handling.
-	In case a response message or ERROR INDICATION message needs to be returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
	If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause value shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality “ignore and notify” have earlier occurred within the same procedure.
Annex A (normative):
Allocation and Pre-emption of Radio Links in the DRNS
A.1	Deriving Allocation Information for a Radio Link
A.1.1	Establishment of a New Radio Link
The Allocation Information for a Radio Link in the case of establishment of a new Radio Link shall be derived as follows:
-	The latest received Allocation/Retention Priority IE for each transport channel shall be used.
Note:	The Allocation/Retention Priority IE for a transport channel may have been received in 
a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for the UE in the DRNS or
b) a procedure adding or modifying the transport channel.
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for all transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link is set to “no priority”, the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link shall be set to “shall not trigger pre-emption”.
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for one or more of the transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link is not set to “no priority”, the allocation priority and the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link shall be set according to the following:
-	The transport channels that have the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE set to “no priority” shall be excluded when setting the allocation priority and pre-emption capability of a Radio Link.
-	The allocation priority for a Radio Link shall be set to highest priority level, given by the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, for all non excluded transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link.
-	If all non-excluded transport channels that are intended to use a Radio Link to be established have the pre-emption capability, given by the Pre-emption Capability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, set to “shall not trigger pre-emption”, the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link shall be set to “shall not trigger pre-emption”.
If one or more non-excluded transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link to be established have the value of the Pre-emption Capability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE set to “may trigger pre-emption”, the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link shall be set to “may trigger pre-emption”.
The derived allocation priority and pre-emption capability are only valid during this allocation/retention process.
A.1.2	Modification of an Existing Radio Link
The Allocation Information for a Radio Link in the case of modification of a Radio Link (addition or modification of transport channels using the Radio Link) shall be derived as follows:
-	The latest received Allocation/Retention Priority IE for each transport channel shall be used.
Note:	The Allocation/Retention Priority IE for a transport channel may have been received in 
a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for the UE in the DRNS,
b) a previous procedure adding or modifying the transport channel, or
c) the current procedure adding or modifying the transport channel.
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for all transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio Link is set to “no priority”, the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall be set to “shall not trigger pre-emption”.
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for one or more of the transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio Link is not set to “no priority”, the allocation priority of and the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall be set according to the following:
-	The transport channels to be added or modified that have the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE set to “no priority” shall be excluded when setting the allocation priority and pre-emption capability of a Radio Link to be modified.
-	The allocation priority for a Radio Link to be modified shall be set to highest priority level, given by the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, for all the non-excluded transport channels that are to be added or modified.
-	If all non-excluded transport channels that are to be added or modified in the Radio Link have the pre-emption capability, given by the Pre-emption Capability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, set to “shall not trigger pre-emption”, the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall be set to “shall not trigger pre-emption”.
If one or more of the non-excluded transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio Link have the value of the Pre-emption Capability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE set to “may trigger pre-emption”, the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall be set to “may trigger pre-emption”.
The derived allocation priority and pre-emption capability are only valid during this allocation/retention process.
A.2	Deriving Retention Information for a Radio Link
The Retention Information for an existing Radio Link shall be derived as follows:
-	The latest received Allocation/Retention Priority IE for each transport channel shall be used.
Note:	The Allocation/Retention Priority IE for a transport channel may have been received in 
a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for the UE in the DRNS or
b) a procedure adding or modifying the transport channel.
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for one or more transport channels using the Radio Link is set to “no priority”, the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set to “not pre-emptable”.
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for all the transport channels using the Radio Link is not set to “no priority”, the retention priority of the Radio Link and the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set according to the following:
-	The retention priority for a Radio Link shall be set to highest priority level, given by the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, for all transport channels that uses the Radio Link.
-	If all transport channels that uses the Radio Link have the pre-emption vulnerability, given by the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, set to “pre-emptable”, the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set to “pre-emptable”.
If one or more transport channels that uses the Radio Link have the value of the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE set to “not pre-emptable”, the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set to “not pre-emptable”.
The derived retention priority and pre-emption vulnerability are valid until they are changed, or until the Radio Link is deleted. When new transport channels are added to or deleted from the Radio Link or when existing transport channels are modified with regards to the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, the retention information shall be derived again according to above.
A.3	The Allocation/Retention Process
The DRNS shall establish or modify the resources for a Radio Link according to:
-	The value of the Allocation Information (allocation priority and pre-emption capability) of the Radio to be established or modified. The Allocation Information is derived according to clause A.1.
-	The value of the Retention Information (retention priority and pre-emption vulnerability) of existing Radio Links. The Retention Information derived according to clause A.2.
-	The resource situation in the DRNS.
Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption functionality is operator dependent, the pre-emption indicators (pre-emption capability and pre-emption vulnerability) shall be treated as follows:
-.	If the pre-emption capability for a Radio Link to be established or modified is set to “may trigger pre-emption” and the resource situation so requires, the DRNS may trigger the pre-emption process in clause A.4 to free resources for this allocation request.
-.	If the pre-emption capability for a Radio Link to be established or modified is set to “shall not trigger pre-emption”, then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption process in clause A.4.
-.	If the pre-emption vulnerability for an existing Radio Link is set to “pre-emptable”, then this Radio Link shall be included in the pre-emption process in clause A.4.
-.	If the pre-emption vulnerability for an existing Radio Link is set to “not pre-emptable”, then this Radio Link shall not be included in the pre-emption process in clause A.4.
A.4	The Pre-emption Process
The pre-emption process shall only pre-empt Radio Links with lower retention priority than the allocation priority of the Radio Link to be established or modified. The Radio Links to be pre-empted shall be selected in ascending order of the retention priority.
When the pre-emption process detects that one or more Radio Links have to be pre-empted to free resources for a Radio Link(s) to be established or modified, the DRNS shall initiate the Radio Link Pre-emption procedure for all the UE Contexts having Radio Links selected for pre-emption and start the TPreempt timer.
When enough resources are freed to establish or modify the Radio Link(s) according to the request, the DRNS shall stop the TPreempt timer and complete the procedure that triggered the pre-emption process in accordance with the “Successful Operation” subclause of the procedure.
If the TPreempt timer expires, the DRNS shall reject the procedure that triggered the pre-emption process and complete the procedure in accordance with the “Unsuccessful Operation” subclause of the procedure.
Annex B (informative):
Measurement Reporting
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to “Event A” (figure B.1), the Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated when the measured entity rises above the requested threshold and stays there for the requested hysteresis time. If no hysteresis time is given, the value zero shall be used for the hysteresis time.

Figure B.1: Event A reporting with Hysteresis Time specified
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to “Event B” (figure B.2), the Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated when the measured entity falls below the requested threshold and stays there for the requested hysteresis time. If no hysteresis time is given, the value zero shall be used for the hysteresis time.

Figure B.2: Event B reporting with Hysteresis Time specified
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to “Event C” (figure B.3), the Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated always when the measured entity rises by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the requested time. The reporting in figure B.3 is initiated if the Rising Time T1 is less than the requested time.

Figure B.3: Event C reporting
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to “Event D” (figure B.4), the Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated always when the measured entity falls by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the requested time. The reporting in figureB.4 is initiated if the Falling Time T1 is less than the requested time.

Figure B.4: Event D reporting

When the Report Characteristics IE is set to “Event E” (figure B.5), the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated always when the measured entity rises above the “Measurement Threshold 1” and stays there for the “Measurement Hysteresis Time” (T1 in figure B.5). If Report Periodicity IE is provided DRNS shall also initiate Measurement Reporting procedure periodically. The periodic reporting continues although the measured entity falls below the “Measurement Threshold 1” and is terminated by the Report B.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measured entity falls below the “Measurement Threshold 2” and stays there for the “Measurement Hysteresis Time” (T1) the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) is initiated and the periodic reporting is terminated.

Figure B.5: Event E reporting with Hysteresis Time specified and Periodic Reporting requested
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to “Event F” (figure B.6), the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated always when the measured entity falls below the “Measurement Threshold 1” and stays there for the “Measurement Hysteresis Time” (T1 in figure B.6). If Report Periodicity IE is provided DRNS shall also initiate Measurement Reporting procedure periodically. The periodic reporting continues although the measured entity rises above the “Measurement Threshold 1” and is terminated by the Report B.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measured entity rises above the “Measurement Threshold 2” and stays there for the “Measurement Hysteresis Time” (T1) Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) is initiated and the periodic reporting is terminated.

Figure B.6: Event F reporting with Hysteresis Time specified and Periodic Reporting requested
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to “Event H” (figure B.7), the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated when the measurement value of measured entity rises above the Measurement Threshold 1 and stays above the threshold for the Measurement Hysteresis Time (T1 in figure B.7).] The measurement value of measured entity in Report A substitutes the Measurement Base value for the consequent measurement reporting.
When the Report A conditions has been met and the measurement value of measured entity rises above or falls below the Measurement Base Value by Measurement Fluctuation Range (H1 in figure B.7), and stays there for the Measurement Hysteresis Time (Th in figure B.7) counting from the beginning of every Report Periodicity, the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B or Report C) is initiated. The the measurement value of measured entity in (Report B or Report C) substitutes the Measurement Base value for the consequent measurement reporting.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measurement value of measured entity falls below the Measurement Threshold 2 and stays there for the Measurement Hysteresis Time (Th in figure B.7), the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report D) is initiated and the reporting is terminated.

Annex D (normative):
DRNS Behaviour at SRNC or RNSAP Signalling Bearer Failure
This annex describes the DRNC actions in the event of SRNC or RNSAP Signalling Bearer failure when all or some of the UE Contexts related to the SRNC need to be removed in DRNC.
D.1	Detection of SRNC or RNSAP Signalling Bearer/Connection Failure
Termination of all or some of the UE Contexts in DRNC which are related to an SRNC may be triggered due to failure of SRNC, RNSAP Signalling Bearer or the Iur signalling connection of an UE(s).
D.1.1	Termination of all UE Contexts Related to a Specific SRNC
Termination of all UE Contexts in DRNC which are related to a specific SRNC is triggered if the RNSAP Signalling Bearer failure is detected by the RNSAP according to the procedure described in the sub-clause 4.5.1.5.1 of TS 25.420. By “all” UE Contexts, it means all Ues having dedicated and/or common channel resources.
D.1.2	Termination of Specific UE Context
Termination of a specific UE Context in DRNC is triggered for an UE which has dedicated transport channel resources according to the procedure described in the sub-clause 4.5.1.5.2 of TS 25.420.
D.2	DRNC Actions at UE Context Termination
When termination of the UE Context is required, the DRNC shall remove any common and/or dedicated radio resources related to the UE Context. The DRNC shall also initiate release of the dedicated or common user plane resources that were involved in these UE contexts. In addition, if it is possible the DRNC shall release the RRC connection.
