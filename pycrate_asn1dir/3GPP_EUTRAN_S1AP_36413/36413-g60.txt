3	Definitions and abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. 
A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
ACL functionality: A functionality controlling the access to network nodes. In case of Access Control Lists (ACL) functionality is applied in a network node the network node may only accept connections from other peer network nodes once the source addresses of the sending network node is already known in the target node.
CSG Cell: an E-UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG indicator set to true and a CSG identity. This cell operates in Closed Access Mode as defined in TS 22.220 [28].
DAPS Handover: as defined in TS 36.300 [14].
DCN-ID: DCN identity identifies a specific decicated core network (DCN).
Dual Connectivity: as defined in TS 36.300 [14].
Elementary Procedure: S1AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between eNBs and the EPC. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as standalone procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of several S1AP EPs together or together with EPs from other interfaces is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g., TS 23.401 [11] and TS 36.300 [14]).
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
-	On time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
-	One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined for successful outcome.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
eNB UE S1AP ID: as defined in TS 36.401 [2]. 
Hybrid Cell: an E-UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG indicator set to false and a CSG identity. This cell operates in Hybrid Access Mode as defined in TS 22.220 [28].
MME UE S1AP ID: as defined in TS 36.401 [2].
E-RAB: as defined in TS 36.401 [2].
NOTE 1:	The E-RAB is either a default E-RAB or a dedicated E-RAB.
E-RAB ID: the E-RAB ID uniquely identifies an E-RAB for one UE.
NOTE 2:	The E-RAB ID remains unique for the UE even if the UE-associated logical S1-connection is released during periods of user inactivity.
Data Radio Bearer: the Data Radio bearer transports the packets of an E-RAB between a UE and an eNB. There is a one-to-one mapping between the E-RAB and the Data Radio Bearer.
Secondary Cell Group: as defined in TS 36.300 [14].
UE-associated signalling: When S1-AP messages associated to one UE uses the UE-associated logical S1-connection for association of the message to the UE in eNB and EPC.
UE-associated logical S1-connection: The UE-associated logical S1-connection uses the identities MME UE S1AP ID and eNB UE S1AP ID according to definition in TS 23.401 [11]. For a received UE associated S1-AP message the MME identifies the associated UE based on the MME UE S1AP ID IE and the eNB identifies the associated UE based on the eNB UE S1AP ID IE. The UE-associated logical S1-connection may exist before the S1 UE context is setup in eNB.

4	General
4.1	Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which “shall” be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node “shall” perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which “shall, if supported” be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node “shall, if supported,” perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see clause 10.
4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word “procedure”, e.g., E-RAB procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word “message”, e.g., MESSAGE NAME message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation “IE”, e.g., Information Element IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the “Value” is written as it is specified in subclause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g., “Value”.
5	S1AP Services
S1AP provides the signalling service between E-UTRAN and the evolved packet core (EPC) that is required to fulfil the S1AP functions described in clause 7. S1AP services are divided into two groups:
Non UE-associated services:	They are related to the whole S1 interface instance between the eNB and MME utilising a non UE-associated signalling connection.
UE-associated services:	They are related to one UE. S1AP functions that provide these services are associated with a UE-associated signalling connection that is maintained for the UE in question.
6	Services Expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of S1AP messages. S1AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
7	Functions of S1AP
The S1AP protocol has the following functions:
-	E-RAB management function: This overall functionality is responsible for setting up, modifying and releasing E-RABs, which are triggered by the MME. The release and modification of E-RABs may be triggered by the eNB as well.
-	Initial Context Transfer function: This functionality is used to establish an S1UE context in the eNB, to setup the default IP connectivity, to setup one or more E-RAB(s) if requested by the MME, and to transfer NAS signalling related information to the eNB if needed.
-	UE Capability Info Indication function: This functionality is used to provide the UE Capability Info when received from the UE to the MME.
-	Mobility Functions for UEs in LTE_ACTIVE in order to enable
-	a change of eNBs within SAE/LTE (Inter MME/Serving SAE-GW Handovers) via the S1 interface (with EPC involvement).
-	a change of RAN nodes between different RATs (Inter-3GPP-RAT Handovers) via the S1 interface (with EPC involvement).
-	Paging: This functionality provides the EPC with the capability to page the UE.
-	S1 interface management functions comprise the:
-	Reset functionality to ensure a well defined initialisation on the S1 interface.
-	Error Indication functionality to allow a proper error reporting/handling in cases where no failure messages are defined.
-	Overload function to indicate the load situation in the control plane of the S1 interface. 
-	Load balancing function to ensure equally loaded MMEs within an MME pool area
-	S1 Setup functionality for initial S1 interface setup for providing configuration information
-	eNB and MME Configuration Update functions are to update application level configuration data needed for the eNB and MME to interoperate correctly on the S1 interface.
-	NAS Signalling transport function between the UE and the MME is used:
-	to transfer and reroute NAS signalling related information and to establish the S1 UE context in the eNB.
-	to transfer NAS signalling related information when the S1 UE context in the eNB is already established.
-	S1 UE context Release function: This functionality is responsible to manage the release of UE specific context in the eNB and the MME.
-	UE Context Modification function: This functionality allows to modify the established UE Context partly.
-	UE Context Resumption function: This functionality allows keeping the UE Context in the eNB for a UE in RRC_IDLE that has been enabled to use User Plane EPS Optimization (see TS 23.401 [11]) and to resume the RRC connection without the need to re-establish the UE Context.
-	Status Transfer: This functionality transfers PDCP SN Status information from source eNB to target eNB in support of in-sequence delivery and duplication avoidance for intra LTE handover. 
-	Trace function: This functionality is to control a trace session recording for a UE in ECM_CONNECTED or to control an MDT session transferring MDT measurements collected by the UE.
-	Location Reporting: This functionality allows MME to be aware of the UE’s current location.
-	LPPa Signalling transport: This functionality transfers LPPa messages between eNB and E-SMLC over the S1 interface.
-	S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling function: This functionality is to carry CDMA2000 signalling between UE and CDMA2000 RAT over the S1 Interface.
-	Warning message transmission function:
This functionality provides the means to start and overwrite the broadcasting of warning message.
-	RAN Information Management (RIM) function: This functionality allows the request and transfer of RAN information (e.g., GERAN system information) between two RAN nodes via the core network.
-	Configuration Transfer function: This functionality allows the request and transfer of RAN configuration information (e.g., SON information) between two RAN nodes via the core network. 
-	UE Radio Capability Match function. The functionality enables the eNB to derive and provide an indication to the MME whether the UE radio capabilities are compatible with the network configuration for voice continuity.
-	PWS Restart Indication function. The functionality enables the eNB to inform the MME that PWS information for some or all cells of the eNB are available for reloading from the CBC if needed.
-	PWS Failure Indication function. The functionality enables the eNB to inform the MME that ongoing PWS operation for one or more cells of the eNB has failed.
-	Connection Establishment Indication function. The functionality enables the MME to complete the establishment of the UE-associated logical S1-connection.
-	Retrieve UE Information function. The functionality enables the eNB to request UE information from the MME.
-	UE Information Transfer function. The functionality enables the MME to transfer UE information to the eNB.
-	CP Relocation function. The functionality enables the initiation of the UE-associated logical S1-connection for a NB-IOT UE using Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation following a re-establishment request.
-	Report of Secondary RAT data volumes function. The functionality enables the eNB to report Secondary RAT data usage information in case of EN-DC as specified in TS 23.401 [11].
-	QMC function. The functionality enables the eNB to collect QoE measurements from the UE.

The following applies concerning interference between Elementary Procedures:
-	The Reset procedure takes precedence over all other EPs.
-	The UE Context Release procedure takes precedence over all other EPs that are using the UE-associated signalling. 
8.2	E-RAB Management procedures
8.2.1	E-RAB Setup
8.2.1.1	General
The purpose of the E-RAB Setup procedure is to assign resources on Uu and S1 for one or several E-RABs and to setup corresponding Data Radio Bearers for a given UE. The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.2.1.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: E-RAB Setup procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message to the eNB. 
-	The E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the information required by the eNB to build the E-RAB configuration consisting of at least one E-RAB and for each E-RAB to setup include an E-RAB to be Setup Item IE. 
Upon reception of the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message, and if resources are available for the requested configuration, the eNB shall execute the requested E-RAB configuration. For each E-RAB and based on the E-RAB level QoS parameters IE the eNB shall establish a Data Radio Bearer and allocate the required resources on Uu. The eNB shall pass the NAS-PDU IE and the value contained in the E-RAB ID IE received for the E-RAB for each established Data Radio Bearer to the UE. The eNB does not send the NAS PDUs associated to the failed Data radio bearers to the UE. The eNB shall allocate the required resources on S1 for the E-RABs requested to be established.
If the Correlation ID IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message towards the eNB with L-GW function for LIPA operation, then the eNB shall use this information for LIPA operation for the concerned E-RAB.
If the SIPTO Correlation ID IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message towards the eNB with L-GW function for SIPTO@LN operation, then the eNB shall use this information for SIPTO@LN operation for the concerned E-RAB. 
If the Bearer Type IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message and is set to "non IP", then the eNB shall not perform IP header compression for the concerned E-RAB.
If the Ethernet Type IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message and is set to "True", then the eNB shall, if supported, take this into account to perform header compression appropriately for the concerned E-RAB.
The E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message may contain 
-	the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE. 
If the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST the eNB shall
-	replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate by the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context;
-	use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for non-GBR Bearers for the concerned UE.
If the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is not contained in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message, the eNB shall use the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate which is stored in the UE context. 
The eNB shall establish or modify the resources according to the values of the Allocation and Retention Priority IE (priority level and pre-emption indicators) and the resource situation as follows:
-	The eNB shall consider the priority level of the requested E-RAB, when deciding on the resource allocation.
-	The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (individually or in combination) be used to determine whether the E-RAB setup has to be performed unconditionally and immediately. If the requested E-RAB is marked as “may trigger pre-emption” and the resource situation requires so, the eNB may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced release of a lower priority E-RAB which is marked as “pre-emptable”. Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption procedure are operator-dependent, the pre-emption indicators shall be treated as follows:
1.	The values of the last received Pre-emption Vulnerability IE and Priority Level IE shall prevail.
2.	If the Pre-emption Capability IE is set to “may trigger pre-emption”, then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption procedure.
3.	If the Pre-emption Capability IE is set to “shall not trigger pre-emption”, then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption procedure.
4.	If the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE is set to “pre-emptable”, then this E-RAB shall be included in the pre-emption process.
5.	If the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE is set to “not pre-emptable”, then this E-RAB shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
6.	If the Priority Level IE is set to “no priority” the given values for the Pre-emption Capability IE and Pre-emption Vulnerability IE shall not be considered. Instead the values “shall not trigger pre-emption” and “not pre-emptable” shall prevail.
-	The E-UTRAN pre-emption process shall keep the following rules:
1.	E-UTRAN shall only pre‑empt E-RABs with lower priority, in ascending order of priority.
2.	The pre-emption may be done for E-RABs belonging to the same UE or to other UEs.
The eNB shall report to the MME, in the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message, the result for all the requested E-RABs.
-	A list of E-RABs which are successfully established shall be included in the E-RAB Setup List IE.
-	A list of E-RABs which failed to be established, if any, shall be included in the E-RAB Failed to Setup List IE. 
In case of the establishment of an E-RAB the EPC must be prepared to receive user data before the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message has been received.
When the eNB reports unsuccessful establishment of an E-RAB, the cause value should be precise enough to enable the MME to know the reason for an unsuccessful establishment, e.g., “Radio resources not available”, “Failure in the Radio Interface Procedure”.
Interactions with Handover Preparation procedure:
If a handover becomes necessary during E-RAB Setup, the eNB may interrupt the ongoing E-RAB Setup procedure and initiate the Handover Preparation procedure as follows:
1.	The eNB shall send the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message in which the eNB shall indicate, if necessary 
-	all the E-RABs fail with an appropriate cause value, e.g., ”S1 intra system Handover triggered”, “S1 inter system Handover triggered” or “X2 Handover triggered”.
2.	The eNB shall trigger the handover procedure.
8.2.1.3	Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation is specified in the successful operation section.
8.2.1.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB receives a E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing a E-RAB Level QoS Parameters IE which contains a QCI IE indicating a GBR bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 [13]), and which does not contain the GBR QoS Information IE, the eNB shall consider the establishment of the corresponding E-RAB as failed. 
If the eNB receives an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing several E-RAB ID IEs (in the E-RAB To Be Setup List IE) set to the same value, the eNB shall report the establishment of the corresponding E-RABs as failed in the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE with the appropriate cause value, e.g., “Multiple E-RAB ID instances”.
If the eNB receives an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing a E-RAB ID IE (in the E-RAB To Be Setup List IE) set to the value that identifies an active E-RAB (established before the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message was received), the eNB shall report the establishment of the new E-RAB as failed in the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE with the appropriate cause value, e.g., “Multiple E-RAB ID instances”.
If the eNB receives an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing both the Correlation ID and the SIPTO Correlation ID IEs for the same E-RAB, the eNB shall consider the establishment of the corresponding E-RAB as failed.
8.2.2	E-RAB Modify
8.2.2.1	General
The purpose of the E-RAB Modify procedure is to enable modifications of already established E-RABs for a given UE. The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.2.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2.2-1: E-RAB Modify procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message to the eNB. 
-	The E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message shall contain the information required by the eNB to modify one or several E-RABs of the existing E-RAB configuration. 
Information shall be present in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message only when any previously set value for the E-RAB configuration is requested to be modified.
Upon reception of the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, and if resources are available for the requested target configuration, the eNB shall execute the modification of the requested E-RAB configuration. For each E-RAB that shall be modified and for which the Transport Information IE is not included and based on the new E-RAB level QoS parameters IE the eNB shall modify the Data Radio Bearer configuration and change allocation of resources on Uu according to the new resource request. The eNB shall pass the NAS-PDU IE received for the E-RAB to the UE when modifying the Data Radio Bearer configuration. The eNB does not send the NAS PDUs associated to the failed Data radio bearers to the UE. The eNB shall change allocation of resources on S1 according to the new resource request.
If the E-UTRAN failed to modify an E-RAB the E-UTRAN shall keep the E-RAB configuration as it was configured prior the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST.
The E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message may contain the
-	the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE,
-	the Secondary RAT Data Usage Request IE.
If the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is included in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST, the eNB shall
-	replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate by the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context;
-	use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for non-GBR Bearers for the concerned UE.
If the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is not contained in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, the eNB shall use the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate which is stored in the UE context. 
The modification of resources according to the values of the Allocation and Retention Priority IE shall follow the principles described for the E-RAB Setup procedure.
If the Transport Information IE is included in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, the eNB shall use the included information as the new S-GW address and uplink packet destination for the relevant E-RAB as defined in TS 23.401 [11], and it shall ignore the E-RAB Level QoS Parameters and NAS-PDU IEs for the same E-RAB.
The eNB shall report to the MME, in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message, the result for all the requested E-RABs to be modified.
-	A list of E-RABs which are successfully modified shall be included in the E-RAB Modify List IE.
-	A list of E-RABs which failed to be modified, if any, shall be included in the E-RAB Failed to Modify List IE.
When the eNB reports unsuccessful modification of an E-RAB, the cause value should be precise enough to enable the MME to know the reason for an unsuccessful modification, e.g., “Radio resources not available”, “Failure in the Radio Interface Procedure”.
In case of a modification of an E-RAB the EPC must be prepared to receive user data according to the modified E-RAB profile prior to the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message.
If the Secondary RAT Data Usage Request IE set to "requested" was included in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, and the eNB supports EN-DC, LAA, LWA or LWIP and has secondary RAT usage data to report, then the Secondary RAT Usage Report List IE shall be included in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message.
Interactions with Handover Preparation procedure:
If a handover becomes necessary during E-RAB modify, the eNB may interrupt the ongoing E-RAB Modify procedure and initiate the Handover Preparation procedure as follows:
1.	The eNB shall send the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message in which the eNB shall indicate, if necessary 
-	all the E-RABs fail with an appropriate cause value, e.g., “S1 intra system Handover triggered”, “S1 inter system Handover triggered” or “X2 Handover triggered”.
2.	The eNB shall trigger the handover procedure.
8.2.2.3	Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation is specified in the successful operation section.
8.2.2.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB receives a E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message containing a E-RAB Level QoS Parameters IE which contains a QCI IE indicating a GBR bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 [13]) for a E-RAB previously configured as a non-GBR bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 [13]), and which does not contain the GBR QoS Information IE, the eNB shall consider the modification of the corresponding E-RAB as failed. 
If the eNB receives an E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message containing several E-RAB ID IEs (in the E-RAB to be Modified List IE) set to the same value, the eNB shall report the modification of the corresponding E-RABs as failed in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE with the appropriate cause value, e.g., “Multiple E-RAB ID instances”.
If the eNB receives an E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message containing some E-RAB ID IEs that eNB does not recognize, the eNB shall report the corresponding invalid E-RABs as failed in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE with the appropriate cause value, e.g., “Unknown E-RAB ID”.
8.2.3	E-RAB Release
8.2.3.1	General
The purpose of the E-RAB Release procedure is to enable the release of already established E-RABs for a given UE. The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.2.3.2	Successful Operation
8.2.3.2.1	E-RAB Release – MME initiated

Figure 8.2.3.2.1-1: E-RAB Release procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message. 
The E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message shall contain the information required by the eNB to release at least one E-RAB in the E-RAB To Be Released List IE. If a NAS-PDU IE is contained in the message, the eNB shall pass it to the UE.
Upon reception of the E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message the eNB shall execute the release of the requested E-RABs. For each E-RAB to be released the eNB shall release the corresponding Data Radio Bearer and release the allocated resources on Uu. The eNB shall pass the value contained in the E-RAB ID IE received for the E-RAB to the radio interface protocol for each Data Radio Bearer to be released. The eNB shall release allocated resources on S1 for the E-RABs requested to be released.
The E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message may contain 
-	the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE.
If the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND the eNB shall
-	replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate by the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context; the eNB shall use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for non-GBR Bearers for the concerned UE. 
If the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is not contained in the E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message, the eNB shall use the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate which is stored in the UE context.
The eNB shall report to the MME, in the E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message, the result for all the E-RABs to be released.
-	A list of E-RABs which are released successfully shall be included in the E-RAB Release List IE.
-	A list of E-RABs which failed to be released, if any, shall be included in the E-RAB Failed to Release List IE. 
The eNB shall be prepared to receive an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message on an established UE-associated logical S1-connection containing an E-RAB Release List IE at any time and shall always reply to it with an E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message.
The eNB shall, if supported, report in the E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message location information of the UE in the User Location Information IE.
After sending an E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message containing an E-RAB ID within the E-RAB Release List IE, the eNB shall be prepared to receive an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message requesting establishment of an E-RAB with this E-RAB ID.
If the User Location Information IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.401 [11].
If the Secondary RAT Usage Report List IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.401 [11].
8.2.3.2.2	E-RAB Release Indication – eNB initiated

Figure 8.2.3.2.2-1: E-RAB Release INDICATION procedure. Successful operation.
The eNB initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message towards the MME.
The E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message shall contain at least one E-RAB released at the eNB, in the E-RAB Released List IE.
The eNB shall, if supported, report in the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message location information of the UE in the User Location Information IE.
Upon reception of the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message the MME shall normally initiate the appropriate release procedure on the core network side for the E-RABs identified in the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message.
If the User Location Information IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.401 [11].
If the Secondary RAT Usage Report List IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.401 [11].
Interaction with UE Context Release Request procedure:
If the eNB wants to remove all remaining E-RABs, e.g., for user inactivity, the UE Context Release Request procedure shall be used instead. 
8.2.3.3	Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB receives an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message containing multiple E-RAB ID IEs (in the E-RAB To Be Released List IE) set to the same value, the eNB shall initiate the release of one corresponding E-RAB and ignore the duplication of the instances of the selected corresponding E-RABs.

If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
8.7.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.2.2-1: Error Indication procedure, MME originated. Successful operation.

Figure 8.7.2.2-2: Error Indication procedure, eNB originated. Successful operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE. In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by utilising UE associated signalling the MME UE S1AP ID IE and the eNB UE S1AP ID IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If one or both of MME UE S1AP ID IE and the eNB UE S1AP ID IE are not correct, the cause shall be set to appropriate value, e.g., “Unknown or already allocated MME UE S1AP ID”, “Unknown or already allocated eNB UE S1AP ID” or “Unknown or inconsistent pair of UE S1AP ID”.
8.7.2.3	Abnormal Conditions 
Not applicable.
8.7.3	S1 Setup 
8.7.3.1	General
The purpose of the S1 Setup procedure is to exchange application level data needed for the eNB and the MME to correctly interoperate on the S1 interface. This procedure shall be the first S1AP procedure triggered after the TNL association has become operational. The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data in the two nodes and replaces it by the one received and clears MME overload state information at the eNB. If the eNB and MME do not agree on retaining the UE Contexts this procedure also re-initialises the E-UTRAN S1AP UE-related contexts (if any) and erases all related signalling connections in the two nodes like a Reset procedure would do. If the eNB initiating the S1 Setup procedure supports a CSG cell, the procedure shall report the CSG ID(s) of the supported CSGs.
8.7.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.3.2-1: S1 Setup procedure: Successful Operation.
The eNB initiates the procedure by sending a S1 SETUP REQUEST message including the appropriate data to the MME. The MME responds with a S1 SETUP RESPONSE message including the appropriate data.
The exchanged data shall be stored in respective node and used for the duration of the TNL association. When this procedure is finished, the S1 interface is operational and other S1 messages can be exchanged.
If the eNB initiating the S1 SETUP procedure supports one (or more) CSG cell(s), the S1 SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the CSG ID(s) of the supported CSG(s).
If the S1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the eNB Name IE the MME may use this IE as a human readable name of the eNB.
If the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the MME Name IE the eNB may use this IE as a human readable name of the MME.
If the MME Relay Support Indicator IE is included in the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message, the eNB shall consider this information when selecting an appropriate MME for the Relay Node.
If the UE Retention Information IE set to “ues-retained“ was included in the S1 SETUP REQUEST message, then the MME may accept the proposal to retain the existing UE related contexts and signalling connections by including the UE Retention Information IE set to “ues-retained“ in the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message.
If the NB-IoT Default Paging DRX IE is included in the S1 SETUP REQUEST message, the MME will take it into account as specified in TS36.300 [14].
If the Connected en-gNB List IE is included in the S1 SETUP REQUEST message, the MME shall take it into account as specified in TS 36.300 [14].
If the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the ServedDCNs IE then the eNB shall, if supported, use it as defined in TS 23.401 [11].
If the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the GUMMEI Type IE then the eNB shall, if supported, use it to route the UE to the correct MME as specified in TS 23.401 [11].

9.2	Information Element Definitions
9.2.0	General
Subclause 9.2 presents the S1AP IE definitions in tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.3. In case there is contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence. 
The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified in TR 25.921 [40].
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table. In general, “not supported” cause values indicate that the related capability is missing. On the other hand, “not available” cause values indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.
Radio Network Layer cause
Meaning
Unspecified
Sent for radio network layer cause when none of the specified cause values applies.
TX2RELOCOverall Expiry 
The timer guarding the handover that takes place over X2 has abnormally expired.
Successful Handover
Successful handover.
Release due to E-UTRAN generated reason
Release is initiated due to E-UTRAN generated reason.
Handover Cancelled
The reason for the action is cancellation of Handover.
Partial Handover
Provides a reason for the handover cancellation. The HANDOVER COMMAND message from MME contained E-RABs to Release List IE and the source eNB estimated service continuity for the UE would be better by not proceeding with handover towards this particular target eNB.
Handover Failure In Target EPC/eNB Or Target System
The handover failed due to a failure in target EPC/eNB or target system.
Handover Target not allowed
Handover to the indicated target cell is not allowed for the UE in question.
TS1RELOCoverall Expiry
The reason for the action is expiry of timer TS1RELOCoverall.
TS1RELOCprep Expiry
Handover Preparation procedure is cancelled when timer TS1RELOCprep expires.
Cell not available
The concerned cell is not available.
Unknown Target ID
Handover rejected because the target ID is not known to the EPC.
No radio resources available in target cell
Load on target cell is too high.
Unknown or already allocated MME UE S1AP ID
The action failed because the MME UE S1AP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the eNB) is known and already allocated to an existing context.
Unknown or already allocated eNB UE S1AP ID
The action failed because the eNB UE S1AP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the MME) is known and already allocated to an existing context.
Unknown or inconsistent pair of UE S1AP ID
The action failed because both UE S1AP IDs are unknown, or are known but do not define a single UE context.
Handover Desirable for Radio Reasons
The reason for requesting handover is radio related.
Time Critical Handover
Handover is requested for time critical reason i.e., this cause value is reserved to represent all critical cases where the connection is likely to be dropped if handover is not performed.
Resource Optimisation Handover
The reason for requesting handover is to improve the load distribution with the neighbour cells.
Reduce Load in Serving Cell
Load on serving cell needs to be reduced. When applied to handover preparation, it indicates the handover is triggered due to load balancing.
User Inactivity
The action is requested due to user inactivity on all E-RABs, e.g., S1 is requested to be released in order to optimise the radio resources.
Radio Connection With UE Lost
The action is requested due to losing the radio connection to the UE.
Load Balancing TAU Required
The action is requested for all load balancing and offload cases in the MME.
CS Fallback triggered
The action is due to a CS fallback that has been triggered. When it is included in UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message, it indicates the PS service suspension is not required in the EPC.
UE Not Available for PS Service
The action is requested due to a CS fallback to GERAN that has been triggered.
When it is included in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message, it indicates that the PS service suspension is required in the EPC due to the target GERAN cell or the UE has no DTM capability.
Radio resources not available
No requested radio resources are available.
Invalid QoS combination
The action was failed because of invalid QoS combination. 
Inter-RAT Redirection
The release is requested due to inter-RAT redirection or intra-LTE redirection. When it is included in UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message, the behaviour of the EPC is specified in TS 23.401 [11].
Failure in the Radio Interface Procedure
Radio interface procedure has failed.
Interaction with other procedure
The action is due to an ongoing interaction with another procedure.
Unknown E-RAB ID
The action failed because the E-RAB ID is unknown in the eNB.
Multiple E-RAB ID Instances
The action failed because multiple instance of the same E-RAB had been provided to the eNB.
Encryption and/or integrity protection algorithms not supported
The eNB is unable to support any of the encryption and/or integrity protection algorithms supported by the UE.
S1 Intra system Handover triggered
The action is due to a S1 intra system handover that has been triggered.
S1 Inter system Handover triggered
The action is due to a S1 inter system handover that has been triggered.
X2 Handover triggered
The action is due to an X2 handover that has been triggered.
Redirection towards 1xRTT
The release of the UE-associated logical S1 connection is requested due to redirection towards a 1xRTT system e.g., CS fallback to 1xRTT, or SRVCC to 1xRTT, when the PS service suspension is required in the EPC. During this procedure, the radio interface message might but need not include redirection information.
Not supported QCI Value
The E-RAB setup failed because the requested QCI is not supported.
Invalid CSG Id
The CSG ID provided to the target eNB was found invalid.
Release due to Pre-Emption
Release is initiated due to pre-emption.
N26 interface not available
The action failed due to a temporary failure of the N26 interface.
Insufficient UE Capabilities
The procedure can’t proceed due to insufficient UE capabilities.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.0	General
S1AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.691 [4], ITU-T Rec. X.680 [5] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [6].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of S1AP messages. S1AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct a S1AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE:	In the above “IE” means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences will have different IE IDs.
If a S1AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
Subclause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of S1AP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this subclause and the tabular format in subclause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
9.3.1	Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e., the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor interoperability;
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g., to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.

10	Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
10.1	General
Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:
-	Transfer Syntax Error.
-	Abstract Syntax Error.
-	Logical Error.
Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving node:

Figure 10.1-1: Protocol Errors in S1AP.
The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included in the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be included. Other optional information elements within the message may also be included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the reporting is done with a response message. The latter is an exception to what is stated in subclause 4.1.
10.2	Transfer Syntax Error
A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode the received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always detected in the process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error occurs, the receiver should initiate Error Indication procedure with appropriate cause value for the Transfer Syntax protocol error.
Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:
-	Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. E.g., if an IE has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and 12 will be received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax error.
-	Violation in list element constraints. E.g., if a list is defined as containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, than this case will be handled as a transfer syntax error.
-	Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the originator of the message).
-	Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the originator of the message).
10.3	Abstract Syntax Error
10.3.1	General
An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional S1AP entity:
1.	receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE ID);
2.	receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g., ASN.1 definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10, while values 11 to 15 are undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an abstract syntax error using criticality information sent by the originator of the message);
3.	does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence of the concerning object, the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the received message.
4.	receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group;
5.	receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the concerning object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE groups should not have been present in the received message.
Cases 1 and 2 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on received Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is handled based on Criticality information and Presence information for the missing IE/IE group specified in the version of the specification used by the receiver. Case 4 (IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences) and Case 5 (erroneously present conditional IEs or IE groups) result in rejecting the procedure.
If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the remaining message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error that belong to cases 1-3 act according to the Criticality Information and Presence Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract Syntax Error occurred in accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is specified in subclause 10.3.6.
10.3.2	Criticality Information
In the S1AP messages there is criticality information set for individual IEs and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver how to act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended, i.e., the entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully or partially) comprehended shall be treated in accordance with its own criticality information as specified in subclause 10.3.4.
In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing IE/IE group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).
The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the Criticality Information. The three possible values of the Criticality Information for an IE/IE group are:
-	Reject IE.
-	Ignore IE and Notify Sender.
-	Ignore IE.
The following rules restrict when a receiving entity may consider an IE, an IE group, or an EP not comprehended (not implemented), and when action based on criticality information is applicable:
1.	IE or IE group: When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, then other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered comprehended by a receiving entity (some may still remain unsupported).
2.	EP: The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not supported may be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from that standard version is comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.
10.3.3	Presence Information
For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1 transfer syntax, S1AP specifies separately if the presence of these IEs/IE groups is optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application by means of the presence field of the concerning object of class S1AP-PROTOCOL-IES, S1AP-PROTOCOL-IES-PAIR, S1AP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or S1AP-PRIVATE-IES.
The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:
1.	Optional;
2.	Conditional;
3.	Mandatory.
If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence of the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the condition is true according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE group.
If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of the IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE group.
10.3.4	Not comprehended IE/IE group
10.3.4.1	Procedure Code
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality information of the Procedure Code IE according to the following:
Reject IE:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure Code IE marked with “Reject IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall reject the procedure using the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure Code IE marked with “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure Code IE marked with “Ignore IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the procedure.
When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to report an ignored procedure it shall include the Procedure Code IE, the Triggering Message IE, and the Procedure Criticality IE in the Criticality Diagnostics IE.
10.3.4.1A	Type of Message
When the receiving node cannot decode the Type of Message IE, the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
10.3.4.2	IEs other than the Procedure Code and Type of Message
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality information of an IE/IE group other than the Procedure Code IE and Type of Message IE according to the following:
Reject IE:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE group marked with “Reject IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the rejection of one or more IEs/IE group using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Reject IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs marked with “Reject IE”, that the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	if a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Ignore IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with “Ignore IE” which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with “Reject IE” or “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” using a response message defined for the procedure, the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. 
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with “Reject IE” or “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” using the Error Indication procedure, the Procedure Code IE, the Triggering Message IE, Procedure Criticality IE, and the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. 
10.3.5	Missing IE or IE group
The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received message specified in the version of this specification used by the receiver:
Reject IE:
-	if a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Reject IE”; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	if a received message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Reject IE”, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	if a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Reject IE, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	if a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Ignore IE and Notify Sender”, the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	if a received message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Ignore IE and Notify Sender”, the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
-	if a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Ignore IE and Notify Sender”, the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
Ignore IE:
-	if a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Ignore IE”, the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
-	if a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Ignore IE”, the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Reject IE” or “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” using a response message defined for the procedure, the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. 
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality “Reject IE” or “Ignore IE and Notify Sender” using the Error Indication procedure, the Procedure Code IE, the Triggering Message IE, Procedure Criticality IE, and the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. 
10.3.6	IEs or IE groups received in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present
If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional presence are present when the condition is not met (i.e., erroneously present), the receiving node shall behave according to the following:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value “Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)” using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure, and use cause value “Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)”.
-	If a response message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the specification version used by the receiver shall be considered.
10.4	Logical Error
Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly, but the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e., semantic error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with the state of the receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour shall be performed (unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class of the elementary procedure, irrespective of the criticality information of the IEs/IE groups containing the erroneous values.
Class 1:
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1 procedure, and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. Typical cause values are:
-	Semantic Error.
-	Message not compatible with receiver state.
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1 procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure Code IE and the Triggering Message IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
Class 2:
Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure Code IE and the Triggering Message IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
10.5	Exceptions
The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take precedence over any other error handling described in the other subclauses of clause 10.
-	If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local error handling.
-	In case a response message or Error Indication message needs to be returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
-	If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause value shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality “ignore and notify” have earlier occurred within the same procedure.
-	If an AP ID error is detected, the error handling as described in subclause 10.6 shall be applied. 
10.6	Handling of AP ID
NOTE:	The “first message”, the “first returned message” and the “last message” as used below correspond to messages for a UE-associated logical connection. The “first message” has a new AP ID from the sending node and the “first returned message” is the first response message, which has a new APID from the node sending the “first returned message”. Thereafter the two APIDs are included in all messages over the UE-associated logical connection unless otherwise allowed by the specification. The “last message” is a message sent by a node in order to complete the termination of a given UE-associated logical connection, such that no other messages for the same connection are expected in either direction.
If a node receives a first message that includes a remote AP ID which is erroneous, e.g., an AP ID which has been stored previously for another UE-associated logical connection for the same peer node, the receiving node shall initiate an Error Indication procedure with inclusion of only the previously received AP ID from the peer node and an appropriate cause value. In this case, both nodes shall initiate a local release of any established UE-associated logical connection having the erroneous AP ID as local or remote identifier. 
If a node receives a first returned message that includes a remote AP ID which has been stored previously for another UE-associated logical connection for the same peer node, or that includes an AP ID pair which is inconsistent (e.g., the local AP ID is unknown or already allocated to another UE-associated logical connection), the receiving node shall initiate an Error Indication procedure with inclusion of the received AP IDs from the peer node and an appropriate cause value. Both nodes shall initiate a local release of any established UE-associated logical connection (for the same S1 interface) having these AP IDs as local or remote identifier.
If a node receives a message (other than the first or first returned messages) that includes AP ID(s) identifying a logical connection which is unknown to the node (for the same S1 interface): 
-	if this message is not the last message for this UE-associated logical connection, the node shall initiate an Error Indication procedure with inclusion of the received AP ID(s) from the peer node and an appropriate cause value. Both nodes shall initiate a local release of any established UE-associated logical connection (for the same S1 interface) having the erroneous AP ID(s) as local or remote identifier.
-	if this message is the last message for this UE-associated logical connection, the receiving node shall initiate a local release of any established UE-associated logical connection (for the same S1 interface) that have either the local or remote AP ID(s) as identifiers.
Annex A (informative):
S1AP Transparent containers content
Transparent containers are used in order to transfer information from one RAN node to another RAN node. Depending on the particular scenario the behaviour of both involved RAN nodes may be either specified according to the same radio system or according to different radio systems. During an inter-system handover the source RAN node has to adopt to the target RAN node and its requirements. Therefore the container content is encoded according to the rules which are specified for the target radio system. 
In S1AP, there is a single transparent container defined for transporting information from the source to the target RAN node and a single transparent container for transporting information from the target to the source RAN node during handover preparation: the Source to Target Transparent Container IE and the Target to Source Transparent Container IE, which may carry either NG-RAN, E-UTRAN, UTRAN or GERAN specific information.
NOTE:	The definition of generic transparent containers for handover purposes allows to transport them through the core network in a RAT-agnostic way.
In subclause 8.4.1.2, it is described how the transparent container shall be encoded with respect to the scenario in which it is used.
The table below is showing all possible scenarios and definitions according to which the content of the transparent container shall be encoded. Additionally the reference to the specification defining particular IE is given.

Annex C (informative):
Processing of Transparent Containers at the MME
The encoding of the Source to Target Transparent Container and Target to Source Transparent Container IEs in this specification is different from the one specified in TS 25.413 [19].
Irrespective of the mobility scenario (inter-RAT or intra-LTE), the MME always processes these IEs in the following way:
-	The MME shall convey to the eNodeB the information received within
-	the GTPv1-C "UTRAN transparent field" of the "UTRAN Transparent Container" IE across the Gn-interface (see subclause 7.7.38 of TS 29.060 [35]), or
-	the GTPv1-C "BSS Container" (value part octets 4-n) of the "BSS Container" IE across the Gn- interface (see subclause 7.7.72 of TS 29.060 [35]), or
-	the GTPv2 "F-container field" of the "F-Container" IE across the S3/S10- interface (see subclause 8.48 of TS 29.274 [36]).
by including it in the octets of the OCTET STRING of the Source to Target Transparent Container IE, the Target to Source Transparent Container IE or the Target to Source Transparent Container Secondary IE of the corresponding S1AP message.
-	The MME shall convey to the GTP peer the information received within the octets of the OCTET STRING of the Source to Target Transparent Container IE, the Target to Source Transparent Container IE or the Target to Source Transparent Container Secondary IE by including it in
-	the GTPv1-C "UTRAN transparent field" of the "UTRAN Transparent Container" IE across the Gn- interface (see subclause 7.7.38 of TS 29.060 [35]), or
-	the GTPv1-C "BSS Container" (value part octets 4-n) of the "BSS Container" IE across the Gn- interface (see subclause 7.7.72 of TS 29.060 [35]), or
-	the GTPv2 "F-container field" of the "F-Container" IE across the S3/S10- interface (see subclause 8.48 of TS 29.274 [36]).
