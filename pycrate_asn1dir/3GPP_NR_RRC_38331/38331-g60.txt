4.2	Architecture
4.2.1	UE states and state transitions including inter RAT
A UE is either in RRC_CONNECTED state or in RRC_INACTIVE state when an RRC connection has been established. If this is not the case, i.e. no RRC connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE state. The RRC states can further be characterised as follows:
-	RRC_IDLE:
-	A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers;
-	UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;
-	The UE:
-	Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5);
-	Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI;
-	Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
-	Acquires system information and can send SI request (if configured);
-	Performs logging of available measurements together with location and time for logged measurement configured UEs;
-	Performs idle/inactive measurements for idle/inactive measurement configured UEs.
-	RRC_INACTIVE:
-	A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers or by RRC layer;
-	UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;
-	The UE stores the UE Inactive AS context;
-	A RAN-based notification area is configured by RRC layer;
The UE:
-	Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5);
-	Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI and RAN paging using fullI-RNTI;
-	Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
-	Performs RAN-based notification area updates periodically and when moving outside the configured RAN-based notification area;
-	Acquires system information and can send SI request (if configured);
-	Performs logging of available measurements together with location and time for logged measurement configured UEs;
-	Performs idle/inactive measurements for idle/inactive measurement configured UEs.
-	RRC_CONNECTED:
-	The UE stores the AS context;
-	Transfer of unicast data to/from UE;
-	At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX;
-	For UEs supporting CA, use of one or more SCells, aggregated with the SpCell, for increased bandwidth;
-	For UEs supporting DC, use of one SCG, aggregated with the MCG, for increased bandwidth;
-	Network controlled mobility within NR and to/from E-UTRA;
-	The UE:
-	Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5), if configured;
-	Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to determine if data is scheduled for it;
-	Provides channel quality and feedback information;
-	Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting;
-	Acquires system information;
-	Performs immediate MDT measurement together with available location reporting.
Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates an overview of UE RRC state machine and state transitions in NR. A UE has only one RRC state in NR at one time.

4.2.2	Signalling radio bearers
"Signalling Radio Bearers" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RBs) that are used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically, the following SRBs are defined:
-	SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;
-	SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH logical channel;
-	SRB2 is for NAS messages and for RRC messages which include logged measurement information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower priority than SRB1 and may be configured by the network after AS security activation;
-	SRB3 is for specific RRC messages when UE is in (NG)EN-DC or NR-DC, all using DCCH logical channel.
In downlink, piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e. with joint success/failure) procedure: bearer establishment/modification/release. In uplink piggybacking of NAS message is used only for transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup and connection resume.
NOTE 1:	The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.
Once AS security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2 and SRB3, including those containing NAS messages, are integrity protected and ciphered by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the NAS messages, see TS 24.501 [23].
Split SRB is supported for all the MR-DC options in both SRB1 and SRB2 (split SRB is not supported for SRB0 and SRB3).
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, SRB0, SRB1 and SRB3 are assigned with the highest priority Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC), (i.e. CAPC = 1) while CAPC for SRB2 is configurable.
4.3	Services
4.3.1	Services provided to upper layers
The RRC protocol offers the following services to upper layers:
-	Broadcast of common control information;
-	Notification of UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. about a mobile terminating call;
-	Notification of UEs about ETWS and/or CMAS;
-	Transfer of dedicated signalling;
-	Broadcast of positioning assistance data.
4.3.2	Services expected from lower layers
In brief, the following are the main services that RRC expects from lower layers:
-	Integrity protection, ciphering and loss-less in-sequence delivery of information without duplication;
4.4	Functions
The RRC protocol includes the following main functions:
-	Broadcast of system information:
-	Including NAS common information;
-	Information applicable for UEs in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE (e.g. cell (re-)selection parameters, neighbouring cell information) and information (also) applicable for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED (e.g. common channel configuration information);
-	Including ETWS notification, CMAS notification;

5	Procedures
5.1	General
5.1.1	Introduction
This clause covers the general requirements.
5.1.2	General requirements
The UE shall:
1>	process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing of a subsequent message;
NOTE:	Network may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the UE's response of a previously initiated procedure.
1>	within a clause execute the steps according to the order specified in the procedural description;
1>	consider the term 'radio bearer' (RB) to cover SRBs and DRBs unless explicitly stated otherwise;
1>	set the rrc-TransactionIdentifier in the response message, if included, to the same value as included in the message received from the network that triggered the response message;
1>	upon receiving a choice value set to setup:
2>	apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;
1>	upon receiving a choice value set to release:
2>	clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated resources;
1>	in case the size of a list is extended, upon receiving an extension field comprising the entries in addition to the ones carried by the original field (regardless of whether the network signals more entries in total); apply the following generic behaviour unless explicitly stated otherwise:
2>	create a combined list by concatenating the additional entries included in the extension field to the original field while maintaining the order among both the original and the additional entries;
2>	for the combined list, created according to the previous, apply the same behaviour as defined for the original field.
5.1.3	Requirements for UE in MR-DC

NOTE:	This use of these terms deviates from the definition in TS 37.340 [41] and other specifications. In TS 37.340, these terms include also the case where the UE is configured with E-UTRA or NR MCG only (i.e. no NR or E-UTRA SCG) but with one or more bearers terminated in a secondary node (i.e. using NR PDCP).
The UE in (NG)EN-DC only executes a sub-clause of clause 5 in this specification when the subclause:
-	is referred to from a subclause under execution, either in this specification or in TS 36.331 [10]; or
-	applies to a message received on SRB3 (if SRB3 is established); or
-	applies to field(s), IE(s), UE variable(s) or timer(s) in this specification that the UE is configured with.
When executing a subclause of clause 5 in this specification, the UE follows the requirements in clause 5.1.2 and in all subclauses of this specification applicable to the messages (including processing time requirements), fields, IEs, timers and UE variables indicated in the subclause under execution.
5.2	System information
5.2.1	Introduction
System Information (SI) is divided into the MIB and a number of SIBs and posSIBs where:
-	the MIB is always transmitted on the BCH with a periodicity of 80 ms and repetitions made within 80 ms (TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.1) and it includes parameters that are needed to acquire SIB1 from the cell. The first transmission of the MIB is scheduled in subframes as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1 and repetitions are scheduled according to the period of SSB;
-	the SIB1 is transmitted on the DL-SCH with a periodicity of 160 ms and variable transmission repetition periodicity within 160 ms as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 13. The default transmission repetition periodicity of SIB1 is 20 ms but the actual transmission repetition periodicity is up to network implementation. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, SIB1 repetition transmission period is 20 ms. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2/3, SIB1 transmission repetition period is the same as the SSB period (TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). SIB1 includes information regarding the availability and scheduling (e.g. mapping of SIBs to SI message, periodicity, SI-window size) of other SIBs with an indication whether one or more SIBs are only provided on-demand and, in that case, the configuration needed by the UE to perform the SI request. SIB1 is cell-specific SIB;
-	SIBs other than SIB1 and posSIBs are carried in SystemInformation (SI) messages, which are transmitted on the DL-SCH. Only SIBs or posSIBs having the same periodicity can be mapped to the same SI message. SIBs and posSIBs are mapped to the different SI messages. Each SI message is transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows with same length for all SI messages). Each SI message is associated with an SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI message is transmitted. An SI message may be transmitted a number of times within the SI-window. Any SIB or posSIB except SIB1 can be configured to be cell specific or area specific, using an indication in SIB1. The cell specific SIB is applicable only within a cell that provides the SIB while the area specific SIB is applicable within an area referred to as SI area, which consists of one or several cells and is identified by systemInformationAreaID;
-	The mapping of SIBs to SI messages is configured in schedulingInfoList, while the mapping of posSIBs to SI messages is configured in posSchedulingInfoList. Each SIB is contained only in a single SI message. In the case of posSIB, a posSIB carrying GNSS Generic Assistance Data for different GNSS/SBAS [49] is contained in different SI messages. Each SIB and posSIB, including a posSIB carrying GNSS Generic Assistance Data for one GNSS/SBAS, is contained at most once in that SI message;
-	For a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, the network can provide system information through dedicated signalling using the RRCReconfiguration message, e.g. if the UE has an active BWP with no common search space configured to monitor system information, paging, or upon request from the UE.
-	For PSCell and SCells, the network provides the required SI by dedicated signalling, i.e. within an RRCReconfiguration message. Nevertheless, the UE shall acquire MIB of the PSCell to get SFN timing of the SCG (which may be different from MCG). Upon change of relevant SI for SCell, the network releases and adds the concerned SCell. For PSCell, the required SI can only be changed with Reconfiguration with Sync.
NOTE:	The physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take. The maximum SIB1 or SI message size is 2976 bits.
5.2.2	System information acquisition
5.2.2.1	General UE requirements

Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition
The UE applies the SI acquisition procedure to acquire the AS, NAS- and positioning assistance data information. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE, in RRC_INACTIVE and in RRC_CONNECTED.
The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE shall ensure having a valid version of (at least) the MIB, SIB1 through SIB4, SIB5 (if the UE supports E-UTRA), SIB11 (if the UE is configured for idle/inactive measurements), SIB12 (if UE is capable of NR sidelink communication and is configured by upper layers to receive or transmit NR sidelink communication), and SIB13, SIB14 (if UE is capable of V2X sidelink communication and is configured by upper layers to receive or transmit V2X sidelink communication).
The UE shall ensure having a valid version of the posSIB requested by upper layers.
5.2.2.2	SIB validity and need to (re)-acquire SIB
5.2.2.2.1	SIB validity
The UE shall apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 upon cell selection (e.g. upon power on), cell-reselection, return from out of coverage, after reconfiguration with sync completion, after entering the network from another RAT, upon receiving an indication that the system information has changed, upon receiving a PWS notification, upon receiving request (e.g., a positioning request) from upper layers; and whenever the UE does not have a valid version of a stored SIB or posSIB or a valid version of a requested SIB.
When the UE acquires a MIB or a SIB1 or an SI message in a serving cell as described in clause 5.2.2.3, and if the UE stores the acquired SIB, then the UE shall store the associated areaScope, if present, the first PLMN-Identity in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList for non-NPN-only cells or the first NPN identity (SNPN identity in case of SNPN, or PNI-NPN identity in case of PNI-NPN) in the NPN-IdentityInfoList for NPN-only cells, the cellIdentity, the systemInformationAreaID, if present, and the valueTag, if present, as indicated in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB. If the UE stores the acquired posSIB, then the UE shall store the associated areaScope, if present, the cellIdentity, the systemInformationAreaID, if present, the valueTag, if provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element, and the expirationTime if provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element. The UE may use a valid stored version of the SI except MIB, SIB1, SIB6, SIB7 or SIB8 e.g. after cell re-selection, upon return from out of coverage or after the reception of SI change indication. The valueTag and expirationTime for posSIB is optionally provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element, as specified in TS 37.355 [49].

NOTE:	The storage and management of the stored SIBs in addition to the SIBs valid for the current serving cell is left to UE implementation.
The UE shall:
1>	delete any stored version of a SIB after 3 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid;
1>	for each stored version of a SIB:
2>	if the areaScope is associated and its value for the stored version of the SIB is the same as the value received in the si-SchedulingInfo for that SIB from the serving cell:
3>	if the UE is NPN capable and the cell is an NPN-only cell:
4>	if the first NPN identity included in the NPN-IdentityInfoList, the systemInformationAreaID and the valueTag that are included in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the NPN identity, the systemInformationAreaID and the valueTag associated with the stored version of that SIB:
5>	consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
3>	else if the first PLMN-Identity included in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList, the systemInformationAreaID and the valueTag that are included in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the PLMN-Identity, the systemInformationAreaID and the valueTag associated with the stored version of that SIB:
4>	consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
2>	if the areaScope is not present for the stored version of the SIB and the areaScope value is not included in the si-SchedulingInfo for that SIB from the serving cell:
3>	if the UE is NPN capable and the cell is an NPN-only cell:
4>	if the first NPN identity in the NPN-IdentityInfoList, the cellIdentity and valueTag that are included in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the NPN identity, the cellIdentity and the valueTag associated with the stored version of that SIB:
5>	consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
3>	else if the first PLMN-Identity in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList, the cellIdentity and valueTag that are included in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the PLMN-Identity, the cellIdentity and the valueTag associated with the stored version of that SIB:
4>	consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
1>	for each stored version of a posSIB:
2>	if the areaScope is associated and its value for the stored version of the posSIB is the same as the value received in the posSIB-MappingInfo for that posSIB from the serving cell and the systemInformationAreaID included in the si-SchedulingInfo is identical to the systemInformationAreaID associated with the stored version of that posSIB:
3>	if the valueTag (see TS 37.355 [49]) for the posSIB received from the serving cell is identical to the valueTag associated with the stored version of that posSIB; or if the expirationTime (see TS 37.355 [49]) associated with the stored posSIB has not been expired:
4>	consider the stored posSIB as valid for the cell;
2>	if the areaScope is not present for the stored version of the posSIB and the areaScope value is not included in the posSIB-MappingInfo for that posSIB from the serving cell and the cellIdentity for the posSIB received from the serving cell is identical to the cellIdentity associated with the stored version of that posSIB:
3>	if the valueTag (see TS 37.355 [49]) for the posSIB received from the serving cell is identical to the valueTag associated with the stored version of that posSIB; or if the expirationTime (see TS 37.355 [49]) associated with the stored posSIB has not been expired:
4>	consider the stored posSIB as valid for the cell;
5.2.2.2.2	SI change indication and PWS notification
A modification period is used, i.e. updated SI message (other than SI message for ETWS, CMAS and positioning assistance data) is broadcasted in the modification period following the one where SI change indication is transmitted. The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m = 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by system information. The UE receives indications about SI modifications and/or PWS notifications using Short Message transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5). Repetitions of SI change indication may occur within preceding modification period. SI change indication is not applicable for SI messages containing posSIBs.
UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE shall monitor for SI change indication in its own paging occasion every DRX cycle. UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor for SI change indication in any paging occasion at least once per modification period if the UE is provided with common search space, including pagingSearchSpace, searchSpaceSIB1 and searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, on the active BWP to monitor paging, as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 13.
During a modification period where ETWS or CMAS transmission is started or stopped, the SI messages carrying the posSIBs scheduled in posSchedulingInfoList may change, so the UE might not be able to successfully receive those posSIBs in the remainder of the current modification period and next modification period according to the scheduling information received prior to the change.
ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE shall monitor for indications about PWS notification in its own paging occasion every DRX cycle. ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor for indication about PWS notification in any paging occasion at least once every defaultPagingCycle if the UE is provided with common search space, including pagingSearchSpace, searchSpaceSIB1 and searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, on the active BWP to monitor paging.
For Short Message reception in a paging occasion, the UE monitors the PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for paging as specified in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 38.213 [13].
If the UE receives a Short Message, the UE shall:
1>	if the UE is ETWS capable or CMAS capable, the etwsAndCmasIndication bit of Short Message is set, and the UE is provided with searchSpaceSIB1 and searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation on the active BWP or the initial BWP:
2> immediately re-acquire the SIB1;
2>	if the UE is ETWS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB6:
3>	acquire SIB6, as specified in sub-clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
2>	if the UE is ETWS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB7:
3>	acquire SIB7, as specified in sub-clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
2>	if the UE is CMAS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB8:
3>	acquire SIB8, as specified in sub-clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
NOTE:	In case SIB6, SIB7, or SIB8 overlap with a measurement gap it is left to UE implementation how to immediately acquire SIB6, SIB7, or SIB8.
1> if the systemInfoModification bit of Short Message is set:
2>	apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in sub-clause 5.2.2.3 from the start of the next modification period.
5.2.2.3	Acquisition of System Information
5.2.2.3.1	Acquisition of MIB and SIB1
The UE shall:
1>	apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;
1>	if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or
1>	if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
2>	acquire the MIB, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2>	if the UE is unable to acquire the MIB;
3>	perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
2>	else:
3>	perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.1.
1>	if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1 and pagingSearchSpace and has received an indication about change of system information; or
1>	if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1 and the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with sub-clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with sub-clause 5.2.2.1, and, UE has not acquired SIB1 in current modification period; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1, and, the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with sub-clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with sub-clause 5.2.2.1, and, si-BroadcastStatus for the required SIB(s) or posSI-BroadcastStatus for the required posSIB(s) is set to notbroadcasting in acquired SIB1 in current modification period; or
1>	if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or
1>	if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
2>	if ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates SIB1 is transmitted in the cell (TS 38.213 [13]) and if SIB1 acquisition is required for the UE:
3>	acquire the SIB1, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
3>	if the UE is unable to acquire the SIB1:
4>	perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
3>	else:
4>	upon acquiring SIB1, perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.2.
2>	else if SIB1 acquisition is required for the UE and ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates that SIB1 is not scheduled in the cell:
3>	perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5.
NOTE:	The UE in RRC_CONNECTED is only required to acquire broadcasted SIB1 if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.
5.2.2.3.2	Acquisition of an SI message
For SI message acquisition PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) are determined according to searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation. If searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message reception in SI-window are same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213[13]. If searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message are determined based on search space indicated by searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation. PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the SI window. The [x×N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion (s) for SI message in SI-window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, …N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in SI-window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the SI window, PDCCH for an SI message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception SI messages is up to UE implementation.
When acquiring an SI message, the UE shall:
1>	determine the start of the SI-window for the concerned SI message as follows:
2>	if the concerned SI message is configured in the schedulingInfoList:
3>	for the concerned SI message, determine the number n which corresponds to the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by schedulingInfoList in si-SchedulingInfo in SIB1;
3>	determine the integer value x = (n – 1) × w, where w is the si-WindowLength;
3>	the SI-window starts at the slot #a, where a = x mod N, in the radio frame for which SFN mod T = FLOOR(x/N), where T is the si-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2>	else if the concerned SI message is configured in the posSchedulingInfoList and offsetToSI-Used is not configured:
3>	create a concatenated list of SI messages by appending the posSchedulingInfoList in posSI-SchedulingInfo in SIB1 to schedulingInfoList in si-SchedulingInfo in SIB1;
3>	for the concerned SI message, determine the number n which corresponds to the order of entry in the concatenated list;
3>	determine the integer value x = (n – 1) × w, where w is the si-WindowLength;
3>	the SI-window starts at the slot #a, where a = x mod N, in the radio frame for which SFN mod T = FLOOR(x/N), where T is the posSI-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2>	else if the concerned SI message is configured by the posSchedulingInfoList and offsetToSI-Used is configured:
3>	determine the number m which corresponds to the number of SI messages with an associated si-Periodicity of 8 radio frames (80 ms), configured by schedulingInfoList in SIB1;
3>	for the concerned SI message, determine the number n which corresponds to the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by posSchedulingInfoList in SIB1;
3>	determine the integer value x = m × w + (n – 1) × w, where w is the si-WindowLength;
3>	the SI-window starts at the slot #a, where a = x mod N, in the radio frame for which SFN mod T = FLOOR(x/N) +8, where T is the posSI-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
1>	receive the PDCCH containing the scheduling RNTI, i.e. SI-RNTI in the PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for SI message acquisition, from the start of the SI-window and continue until the end of the SI-window whose absolute length in time is given by si-WindowLength, or until the SI message was received;
1>	if the SI message was not received by the end of the SI-window, repeat reception at the next SI-window occasion for the concerned SI message in the current modification period;
NOTE 1:	The UE is only required to acquire broadcasted SI message if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.
NOTE 2:	The UE is not required to monitor PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) corresponding to each transmitted SSB in SI-window.
NOTE 3:	If the concerned SI message was not received in the current modification period, handling of SI message acquisition is left to UE implementation.
NOTE 4:	A UE in RRC_CONNECTED may stop the PDCCH monitoring during the SI window for the concerned SI message when the requested SIB(s) are acquired.
NOTE 5:	A UE capable of NR sidelink communication and configured by upper layers to perform NR sidelink communication on a frequency, may acquire SIB12 from a cell other than current serving cell (for RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE) or current PCell (for RRC_CONNECTED), if SIB12 of current serving cell (for RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE) or current PCell (for RRC_CONNECTED) does not provide configuration for NR sidelink communication for the frequency, and if the other cell providing configuration for NR sidelink communication for the frequency meets the S-criteria as defined in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 36.304 [27].
1>	perform the actions for the acquired SI message as specified in sub-clause 5.2.2.4.

5.3	Connection control
5.3.1	Introduction
5.3.1.1	RRC connection control
RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. The network completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment of the NG connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from the 5GC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the network may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting, but the UE only sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful AS security activation. However, the UE only accepts a re-configuration with sync message when AS security has been activated.
Upon receiving the UE context from the 5GC, the RAN activates AS security (both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial AS security activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate AS security (command and successful response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to activate AS security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to establish SRB2 and DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered. After having initiated the initial AS security activation procedure, the network may initiate the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. the network may do this prior to receiving the confirmation of the initial AS security activation from the UE. In any case, the network will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for the RRC reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2 and DRBs. The network should release the RRC connection if the initial AS security activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails. A configuration with SRB2 without DRB or with DRB without SRB2 is not supported (i.e., SRB2 and at least one DRB must be configured in the same RRC Reconfiguration message, and it is not allowed to release all the DRBs without releasing the RRC Connection). For IAB-MT, a configuration with SRB2 without DRB is supported.
The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by the network. The procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an NR frequency or an E-UTRA carrier frequency.
The suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by the network. When the RRC connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS context and any configuration received from the network, and transits to RRC_INACTIVE state. The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and ciphered.
The resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when the UE needs to transit from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED state or by RRC layer to perform a RNA update or by RAN paging from NG-RAN. When the RRC connection is resumed, network configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE Inactive AS context and any RRC configuration received from the network. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates AS security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s).
In response to a request to resume the RRC connection, the network may resume the suspended RRC connection and send UE to RRC_CONNECTED, or reject the request to resume and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE (with a wait timer), or directly re-suspend the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE, or directly release the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_IDLE, or instruct the UE to initiate NAS level recovery (in this case the network sends an RRC setup message).
NOTE:	In case the UE receives the configurations for NR sidelink communication via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in SIB12 and sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration used in subclause 5.3 are provided by the configurations in SystemInformationBlockType28 and sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR within RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331[10], respectively.
5.3.1.2	AS Security
AS security comprises of the integrity protection and ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).
RRC handles the configuration of the AS security parameters which are part of the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm, if integrity protection and/or ciphering is enabled for a DRB and two parameters, namely the keySetChangeIndicator and the nextHopChainingCount, which are used by the UE to determine the AS security keys upon reconfiguration with sync (with key change), connection re-establishment and/or connection resume.
The integrity protection algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if configured) and DRBs configured with integrity protection, with the same keyToUse value. The ciphering algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if configured) and DRBs configured with the same keyToUse value. For MR-DC, integrity protection is not enabled for DRBs terminated in eNB. Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.
NOTE 0:	All DRBs related to the same PDU session have the same enable/disable setting for ciphering and the same enable/disable setting for integrity protection, as specified in TS 33.501 [11].
RRC integrity protection and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one message/procedure. RRC integrity protection and ciphering for SRBs are never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a 'NULL' ciphering algorithm (nea0).
The 'NULL' integrity protection algorithm (nia0) is used only for SRBs and for the UE in limited service mode, see TS 33.501 [11] and when used for SRBs, integrity protection is disabled for DRBs. In case the ′NULL' integrity protection algorithm is used, 'NULL' ciphering algorithm is also used.
NOTE 1:	Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity protection check has failed and indicate the integrity protection verification check failure to RRC.
The AS applies four different security keys: one for the integrity protection of RRC signalling (KRRCint), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling (KRRCenc), one for integrity protection of user data (KUPint) and one for the ciphering of user data (KUPenc). All four AS keys are derived from the KgNB key. The KgNB key is based on the KAMF key (as specified in TS 33.501 [11]), which is handled by upper layers.
The integrity protection and ciphering algorithms can only be changed with reconfiguration with sync. The AS keys (KgNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc, KUPint and KUPenc) change upon reconfiguration with sync (if masterKeyUpdate is included), and upon connection re-establishment and connection resume.
For each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]) is maintained for each direction. For each radio bearer, the COUNT is used as input for ciphering and integrity protection.
It is not allowed to use the same COUNT value more than once for a given security key. As specified in TS 33.501 subclause 6.9.4.1 [11], the network is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the same RB identity and with the same key, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs, and multiple termination point changes for RLC-UM bearers and multiple termination point changes for RLC-AM bearer with SN terminated PDCP re-establishment (COUNT reset) due to SN only full configuration whilst the key stream inputs (i.e. bearer ID, security key) at MN have not been updated. In order to avoid such re-use, the network may e.g. use different RB identities for RB establishments, change the AS security key, or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and then to RRC_CONNECTED transition.
In order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). In addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (HFN, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE and the network.
For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is the value of the corresponding srb-Identity with the MSBs padded with zeroes.
For a UE provided with an sk-counter, keyToUse indicates whether the UE uses the master key (KgNB) or the secondary key (S-KeNB or S-KgNB) for a particular DRB. The secondary key is derived from the master key and sk-Counter, as defined in TS 33.501[11]. Whenever there is a need to refresh the secondary key, e.g. upon change of MN with KgNB change or to avoid COUNT reuse, the security key update is used (see 5.3.5.7). When the UE is in NR-DC, the network may provide a UE configured with an SCG with an sk-Counter even when no DRB is setup using the secondary key (S-KgNB) in order to allow the configuration of SRB3. The network can also provide the UE with an sk-Counter, even if no SCG is configured, when using SN terminated MCG bearers.

The purpose of this procedure is:
-	to transmit paging information to a UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.
5.3.2.2	Initiation
The network initiates the paging procedure by transmitting the Paging message at the UE's paging occasion as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. The network may address multiple UEs within a Paging message by including one PagingRecord for each UE.

Figure 5.3.3.1-1: RRC connection establishment, successful

Figure 5.3.3.1-2: RRC connection establishment, network reject
The purpose of this procedure is to establish an RRC connection. RRC connection establishment involves SRB1 establishment. The procedure is also used to transfer the initial NAS dedicated information/ message from the UE to the network.
The network applies the procedure e.g.as follows:
-	When establishing an RRC connection;
-	When UE is resuming or re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context. In this case, UE receives RRCSetup and responds with RRCSetupComplete.
5.3.3.1a	Conditions for establishing RRC Connection for NR sidelink communication/V2X sidelink communication
For NR sidelink communication, an RRC connection establishment is initiated only in the following cases:
1>	if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication and related data is available for transmission:
2>	if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink communication is included in sl-FreqInfoList within SIB12 provided by the cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of SIB12 does not include sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal for the concerned frequency;
For V2X sidelink communication, an RRC connection is initiated only when the conditions specified for V2X sidelink communication in subclause 5.3.3.1a of TS 36.331 [10] are met.
NOTE:	Upper layers initiate an RRC connection. The interaction with NAS is left to UE implementation.
5.3.3.2	Initiation

2>	else:
3>	draw a 39-bit random value in the range 0..239-1 and set the ue-Identity to this value;
NOTE 1:	Upper layers provide the 5G-S-TMSI if the UE is registered in the TA of the current cell.
1>	if the establishment of the RRC connection is the result of release with redirect with mpsPriorityIndication (either in NR or E-UTRAN):
2>	set the establishmentCause to mps-PriorityAccess;
1>	else:
2>	set the establishmentCause in accordance with the information received from upper layers;
The UE shall submit the RRCSetupRequest message to lower layers for transmission.

5.3.5	RRC reconfiguration
5.3.5.1	General

Figure 5.3.5.1-1: RRC reconfiguration, successful

Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC reconfiguration, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to establish/modify/release RBs/BH RLC channels, to perform reconfiguration with sync, to setup/modify/release measurements, to add/modify/release SCells and cell groups, to add/modify/release conditional handover configuration, to add/modify/release conditional PSCell change configuration. As part of the procedure, NAS dedicated information may be transferred from the Network to the UE.
RRC reconfiguration to perform reconfiguration with sync includes, but is not limited to, the following cases:
-	reconfiguration with sync and security key refresh, involving RA to the PCell/PSCell, MAC reset, refresh of security and re-establishment of RLC and PDCP triggered by explicit L2 indicators;
-	reconfiguration with sync but without security key refresh, involving RA to the PCell/PSCell, MAC reset and RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery (for AM DRB) triggered by explicit L2 indicators.
-	reconfiguration with sync for DAPS and security key refresh, involving RA to the target PCell, establishment of target MAC, and
-	for non-DAPS bearer: refresh of security and re-establishment of RLC and PDCP triggered by explicit L2 indicators;
-	for DAPS bearer: establishment of RLC for the target PCell, refresh of security and reconfiguration of PDCP to add the ciphering function, the integrity protection function and ROHC function of the target PCell;
-	for SRB: refresh of security and establishment of RLC and PDCP for the target PCell;
-	reconfiguration with sync for DAPS but without security key refresh, involving RA to the target PCell, establishment of target MAC, and:
-	for non-DAPS bearer: RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery (for AM DRB) triggered by explicit L2 indicators.
-	for DAPS bearer: establishment of RLC for target PCell, reconfiguration of PDCP to add the ciphering function, the integrity protection function and ROHC function of the target PCell;
-	for SRB: establishment of RLC and PDCP for the target PCell.
In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, SRB3 can be used for measurement configuration and reporting, for UE assistance (re-)configuration and reporting for power savings, for IP address (re-)configuration and reporting for IAB-nodes, to (re-)configure MAC, RLC, BAP, physical layer and RLF timers and constants of the SCG configuration, and to reconfigure PDCP for DRBs associated with the S-KgNB or SRB3, and to reconfigure SDAP for DRBs associated with S-KgNB in NGEN-DC and NR-DC, and to add/modify/release conditional PSCell change configuration, provided that the (re-)configuration does not require any MN involvement, and to transmit RRC messages between the MN and the UE during fast MCG link recovery. In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, only measConfig, radioBearerConfig, conditionalReconfiguration, bap-Config, iab-IP-AddressConfigurationList, otherConfig and/or secondaryCellGroup are included in RRCReconfiguration received via SRB3, except when RRCReconfiguration is received within DLInformationTransferMRDC.
5.3.5.2	Initiation
The Network may initiate the RRC reconfiguration procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED. The Network applies the procedure as follows:
-	the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during RRC connection establishment) is performed only when AS security has been activated;
-	the establishment of BH RLC Channels for IAB is performed only when AS security has been activated;
-	the addition of Secondary Cell Group and SCells is performed only when AS security has been activated;
-	the reconfigurationWithSync is included in secondaryCellGroup only when at least one RLC bearer or BH RLC channel is setup in SCG;
-	the reconfigurationWithSync is included in masterCellGroup only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup and not suspended;
-	the conditionalReconfiguration for CPC is included only when at least one RLC bearer is setup in SCG;
-	the conditionalReconfiguration for CHO is included only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup and not suspended.

1>	start synchronising to the DL of the target SpCell;
1>	apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1 for the target SpCell;
1>	acquire the MIB of the target SpCell, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
NOTE 1:	The UE should perform the reconfiguration with sync as soon as possible following the reception of the RRC message triggering the reconfiguration with sync, which could be before confirming successful reception (HARQ and ARQ) of this message.
NOTE 2:	The UE may omit reading the MIB if the UE already has the required timing information, or the timing information is not needed for random access.
NOTE 2a:	A UE with DAPS bearer does not monitor for system information updates in the source PCell.
1>	If any DAPS bearer is configured:
2>	create a MAC entity for the target cell group with the same configuration as the MAC entity for the source cell group;
2>	for each DAPS bearer:
3>	establish an RLC entity or entities for the target cell group, with the same configurations as for the source cell group;
3>	establish the logical channel for the target cell group, with the same configurations as for the source cell group;

3>	reconfigure the RLC entity or entities in accordance with the received rlc-Config;
3>	reconfigure the logical channel in accordance with the received mac-LogicalChannelConfig;
NOTE 1:	The network does not re-associate an already configured logical channel with another radio bearer. Hence servedRadioBearer is not present in this case.
NOTE 2:	In DAPS handover, the UE may perform RLC entity re-establishment (if reestablishRLC is set) for an RLC bearer associated with a non-DAPS bearer when indication of successful completion of random access towards target cell is received from lower layers as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
1>	else (a logical channel with the given logicalChannelIdentity is not configured within the same cell group, including the case when full configuration option is used):

NOTE 1:	Void.
NOTE 2:	When determining whether a drb-Identity value is part of the current UE configuration, the UE does not distinguish which RadioBearerConfig and DRB-ToAddModList that DRB was originally configured in. To re-associate a DRB with a different key (KeNB to S-KgNB, KgNB to S-KeNB, KgNB to S-KgNB, or vice versa), the network provides the drb-Identity value in the (target) drb-ToAddModList and sets the reestablishPDCP flag. The network does not list the drb-Identity in the (source) drb-ToReleaseList.
NOTE 3:	When setting the reestablishPDCP flag for a radio bearer, the network ensures that the RLC receiver entities do not deliver old PDCP PDUs to the re-established PDCP entity. It does that e.g. by triggering a reconfiguration with sync of the cell group hosting the old RLC entity or by releasing the old RLC entity.
NOTE 4:	In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters configured by NR RRC unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 5: Ciphering and integrity protection can be enabled or disabled for a DRB. The enabling/disabling of ciphering or integrity protection can be changed only by releasing and adding the DRB.
NOTE 6:	In DAPS handover, the UE may perform PDCP entity re-establishment (if reestablishPDCP is set) or the PDCP data recovery (if recoverPDCP is set) for a non-DAPS bearer when indication of successful completion of random access towards target cell is received from lower layers as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. In this case, the UE suspends data transmission and reception for all non-DAPS bearers in the source MCG for duration of the DAPS handover.

-	the AS security configurations associated with the master key;
-	the SRB1/SRB2 configurations and DRB configurations as configured by radioBearerConfig or radioBearerConfig2.
NOTE 1:	Radio configuration is not just the resource configuration but includes other configurations like MeasConfig. Radio configuration also includes the RLC bearer configurations as configured by RLC-BearerConfig. In case NR-DC or NE-DC is configured, this also includes the entire NR or E-UTRA SCG configuration which are released according to the MR-DC release procedure as specified in 5.3.5.10.
NOTE 1a:	For NR sidelink communication, the radio configuration includes the sidelink RRC configuration received from the network, but does not include the sidelink RRC reconfiguration and sidelink UE capability received from other UEs via PC5-RRC. In addition, the UE considers the new NR sidelink configurations as full configuration, in case of state transition and change of system information used for NR sidelink communication.
NOTE 1b:	To establish the RLC bearer of SRB(s) after release due to fullConfig, the network can include the srb-Identity within srb-ToAddModList (i.e. the UE applies RLC default configuration) and/or provide rlc-BearerToAddModList of concerned SRB(s) explicitly.

2>	establish an RLC entity for the corresponding SRB;
2>	apply the default SRB configuration defined in 9.2.1 for the corresponding SRB;
NOTE 2:	This is to get the SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2 for reconfiguration with sync and SRB2 for resume and reconfiguration after re-establishment) to a known state from which the reconfiguration message can do further configuration.
1>	for each pdu-Session that is part of the current UE configuration:
2>	release the SDAP entity (clause 5.1.2 in TS 37.324 [24]);
2>	release each DRB associated to the pdu-Session as specified in 5.3.5.6.4;
NOTE 3:	This will retain the pdu-Session but remove the DRBs including drb-identity of these bearers from the current UE configuration. Setup of the DRBs within the AS is described in clause 5.3.5.6.5 using the new configuration. The pdu-Session acts as the anchor for associating the released and re-setup DRB. In the AS the DRB re-setup is equivalent with a new DRB setup (including new PDCP and logical channel configurations).

5.3.6	Counter check
5.3.6.1	General

Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure
The counter check procedure is used by the network to request the UE to verify the amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT match with the values indicated by the network.
NOTE:	The procedure enables the network to detect packet insertion by an intruder (a 'man in the middle').
5.3.6.2	Initiation
The network initiates the procedure by sending a CounterCheck message.
NOTE:	The network may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values reaches a specific value.
5.3.6.3	Reception of the CounterCheck message by the UE
Upon receiving the CounterCheck message, the UE shall:
1>	for each DRB that is established:
2>	if no COUNT exists for a given direction (uplink or downlink) because it is a uni-directional bearer configured only for the other direction:
3>	assume the COUNT value to be 0 for the unused direction;
2>	if the drb-Identity is not included in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList:
3>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink set to the value of TX_NEXT – 1 and RX_NEXT – 1 (specified in TS 38.323 [5]), respectively;
2>	else if, for at least one direction, the most significant bits of the COUNT are different from the value indicated in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList:
3>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink set to the value of TX_NEXT – 1 and RX_NEXT – 1 (specified in TS 38.323 [5]), respectively;
1>	for each DRB that is included in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList in the CounterCheck message that is not established:
2>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink with the most significant bits set identical to the corresponding values in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList and the least significant bits set to zero;
1>	submit the CounterCheckResponse message to lower layers for transmission upon which the procedure ends.
5.3.7	RRC connection re-establishment
5.3.7.1	General
	
Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful
	

Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC re-establishment, fallback to RRC establishment, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection. A UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which AS security has been activated with SRB2 and at least one DRB setup or, for IAB, SRB2, may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds if the network is able to find and verify a valid UE context or, if the UE context cannot be retrieved, and the network responds with an RRCSetup according to clause 5.3.3.4.
The network applies the procedure e.g as follows:
-	When AS security has been activated and the network retrieves or verifies the UE context:
-	to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms;
-	to re-establish and resume the SRB1;
-	When UE is re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context:
-	to discard the stored AS Context and release all RBs and BH RLC channels;
-	to fallback to establish a new RRC connection.
If AS security has not been activated, the UE shall not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause 'other'. If AS security has been activated, but SRB2 and at least one DRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are not setup, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause 'RRC connection failure'.

5.4	Inter-RAT mobility
5.4.1	Introduction
Network controlled inter-RAT mobility between NR and E-UTRA is supported, where E-UTRA can be connected to either EPC or 5GC.
5.4.2	Handover to NR
5.4.2.1	General

Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to NR, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network, transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g. E-UTRAN) to NR.
The handover to NR procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination with DRBs, are established in another RAT. Handover from E-UTRA to NR applies only after integrity has been activated in E-UTRA.
5.4.2.2	Initiation
The RAN using another RAT initiates the handover to NR procedure, in accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT, by sending the RRCReconfiguration message via the radio access technology from which the inter-RAT handover is performed.
The network applies the procedure as follows:
-	to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated in the other RAT;
-	to re-establish SRBs and one or more DRBs;
5.4.2.3	Reception of the RRCReconfiguration by the UE
The UE shall:
1>	apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values are provided in SIB1;
1>	apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
1>	perform RRC reconfiguration procedure as specified in 5.3.5;
NOTE:	If the UE is connected to 5GC of the source E-UTRA cell, the delta configuration for PDCP and SDAP can be used for intra-system inter-RAT handover. For other cases, source RAT configuration is not considered when the UE applies the reconfiguration message of target RAT.

-	handover, i.e. the MobilityFromNRCommand message includes radio resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell;
5.4.3.2	Initiation
The network initiates the mobility from NR procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a MeasurementReport or an MCGFailureInformation message, by sending a MobilityFromNRCommand message. The network applies the procedure as follows:
-	the procedure is initiated only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
-	the procedure is not initiated if any DAPS bearer is configured;
5.4.3.3	Reception of the MobilityFromNRCommand by the UE
The UE shall:
1>	stop timer T310, if running;
1>	stop timer T312, if running;
1>	if T316 is running:
2>	stop timer T316;
2>	clear the information included in VarRLF-Report, if any;
1>	if T390 is running:
2>	stop timer T390 for all access categories;
2>	perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
1>	if the targetRAT-Type is set to eutra:
2>	consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;
2>	forward the nas-SecurityParamFromNR to the upper layers, if included;
1>	else if the targetRAT-Type is set to utra-fdd:
2>	consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards UTRA-FDD;
2>	forward the nas-SecurityParamFromNR to the upper layers, if included;
1>	access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specifications of the target RAT.
5.4.3.4	Successful completion of the mobility from NR
Upon successfully completing the handover, at the source side the UE shall:
1>	reset MAC;
1>	stop all timers that are running except T325, T330 and T400;
1>	release ran-NotificationAreaInfo, if stored;
1>	release the AS security context including the KRRCenc key, the KRRCint key, the KUPint key and the KUPenc key, if stored;
1>	release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity and the MAC configuration;
1>	release the associated PDCP entity and SDAP entity for all established RBs;
NOTE :	PDCP and SDAP configured by the source RAT prior to the handover that are reconfigured and re-used by target RAT when delta signalling (i.e., during inter-RAT intra-system handover when fullConfig is not present) is used, are not released as part of this procedure.
1>	if the targetRAT-Type is set to eutra and the nas-SecurityParamFromNR is included: or
1>	if the targetRAT-Type is set to utra-fdd:
2>	indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together with the release cause 'other'.
5.4.3.5	Mobility from NR failure
The UE shall:
1>	if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target radio access technology:
2>	if the targetRAT-Type in the received MobilityFromNRCommand is set to eutra and the UE supports Radio Link Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO EUTRA:
3>	store handover failure information in VarRLF-Report according to 5.3.10.5;
2>	if voiceFallbackIndication is included in the MobilityFromNRCommand message:
3>	attempt to select an E-UTRA cell:
4>	if a suitable E-UTRA cell is selected:
5>	perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11, with release cause 'RRC connection failure';
4>	else:
5>	revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell;

2>	else:
3>	revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell;
3>	initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in subclause 5.3.7;
1>	else if the UE is unable to comply with any part of the configuration included in the MobilityFromNRCommand message; or
1>	if there is a protocol error in the inter RAT information included in the MobilityFromNRCommand message, causing the UE to fail the procedure according to the specifications applicable for the target RAT:

The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:
1.	Measurement objects: A list of objects on which the UE shall perform the measurements.
-	For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object indicates the frequency/time location and subcarrier spacing of reference signals to be measured. Associated with this measurement object, the network may configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of 'blacklisted' cells and a list of 'whitelisted' cells. Blacklisted cells are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting. Whitelisted cells are the only ones applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
-	The measObjectId of the MO which corresponds to each serving cell is indicated by servingCellMO within the serving cell configuration.
-	For inter-RAT E-UTRA measurements a measurement object is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this E-UTRA carrier frequency, the network can configure a list of cell specific offsets and a list of 'blacklisted' cells. Blacklisted cells are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
-	For inter-RAT UTRA-FDD measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single UTRA-FDD carrier frequency.
-	For CBR measurement of NR sidelink communication, a measurement object is a set of transmission resource pool(s) on a single carrier frequency for NR sidelink communication.
-	For CLI measurements a measurement object indicates the frequency/time location of SRS resources and/or CLI-RSSI resources, and subcarrier spacing of SRS resources to be measured.
2.	Reporting configurations: A list of reporting configurations where there can be one or multiple reporting configurations per measurement object. Each measurement reporting configuration consists of the following:
-	Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event description.
-	RS type: The RS that the UE uses for beam and cell measurement results (SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).
-	Reporting format: The quantities per cell and per beam that the UE includes in the measurement report (e.g. RSRP) and other associated information such as the maximum number of cells and the maximum number beams per cell to report.
In case of conditional reconfiguration, each configuration consists of the following:
-	Execution criteria: The criteria the UE uses for conditional reconfiguration execution.
-	RS type: The RS that the UE uses for obtaining beam and cell measurement results (SS/PBCH block-based or CSI-RS-based), used for evaluating conditional reconfiguration execution condition.
3.	Measurement identities: For measurement reporting, a list of measurement identities where each measurement identity links one measurement object with one reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities, it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity is also included in the measurement report that triggered the reporting, serving as a reference to the network. For conditional reconfiguration triggering, one measurement identity links to exactly one conditional reconfiguration trigger configuration. And up to 2 measurement identities can be linked to one conditional reconfiguration execution condition.
4.	Quantity configurations: The quantity configuration defines the measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and related reporting, and for periodical reporting of that measurement. For NR measurements, the network may configure up to 2 quantity configurations with a reference in the NR measurement object to the configuration that is to be used. In each configuration, different filter coefficients can be configured for different measurement quantities, for different RS types, and for measurements per cell and per beam.
5.	Measurement gaps: Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements.
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED maintains a measurement object list, a reporting configuration list, and a measurement identities list according to signalling and procedures in this specification. The measurement object list possibly includes NR measurement object(s), CLI measurement object(s) and inter-RAT objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes NR and inter-RAT reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1.	The NR serving cell(s) – these are the SpCell and one or more SCells.
2.	Listed cells – these are cells listed within the measurement object(s).
3.	Detected cells – these are cells that are not listed within the measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the SSB frequency(ies) and subcarrier spacing(s) indicated by the measurement object(s).
For NR measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on the serving cell(s), listed cells and/or detected cells. For inter-RAT measurements object(s) of E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and detected cells and, for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements, the UE measures and reports on the configured resources on the indicated frequency. For inter-RAT measurements object(s) of UTRA-FDD, the UE measures and reports on listed cells. For CLI measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on configured measurement resources (i.e. SRS resources and/or CLI-RSSI resources).
Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in sub-clause 5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the VarMeasConfig unless explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration procedure covers the direct UE action related to the received measConfig.
In NR-DC, the UE may receive two independent measConfig:
-	a measConfig, associated with MCG, that is included in the RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB1; and
-	a measConfig, associated with SCG, that is included in the RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB3, or, alternatively, included within a RRCReconfiguration message embedded in a RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB1.
In this case, the UE maintains two independent VarMeasConfig and VarMeasReportList, one associated with each measConfig, and independently performs all the procedures in clause 5.5 for each measConfig and the associated VarMeasConfig and VarMeasReportList, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
The configurations related to CBR measurments are only included in the measConfig associated with MCG.
5.5.2	Measurement configuration
5.5.2.1	General
The network applies the procedure as follows:
-	to ensure that, whenever the UE has a measConfig associated with a CG, it includes a measObject for the SpCell and for each NR SCell of the CG to be measured;
-	to configure at most one measurement identity across all CGs using a reporting configuration with the reportType set to reportCGI;
-	to configure at most one measurement identity per CG using a reporting configuration with the ul-DelayValueConfig;
-	to ensure that, in the measConfig associated with a CG:
-	for all SSB based measurements there is at most one measurement object with the same ssbFrequency;
-	an smtc1 included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value and that an smtc2 included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value and that an smtc3list included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value;
-	to ensure that all measurement objects configured in this specification and in TS 36.331 [10] with the same ssbFrequency have the same ssbSubcarrierSpacing;
-	to ensure that, if a measurement object associated with the MCG has the same ssbFrequency as a measurement object associated with the SCG:
-	for that ssbFrequency, the measurement window according to the smtc1 configured by the MCG includes the measurement window according to the smtc1 configured by the SCG, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
-	if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in measurementSlots in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to the same value. Also, the endSymbol is the same in both objects.
-	to ensure that, if a measurement object has the same ssbFrequency as a measurement object configured in TS 36.331 [10]:
-	for that ssbFrequency, the measurement window according to the smtc configured in TS 36.331 [10] includes the measurement window according to the smtc1 configured in TS 38.331, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
-	if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in measurementSlots in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to the same value. Also, the endSymbol is the same in both objects.
-	when the UE is in NE-DC, NR-DC, or NR standalone, to configure at most one measurement identity across all CGs using a reporting configuration with the reportType set to reportSFTD;
For CSI-RS resources, the network applies the procedure as follows:
-	to ensure that all CSI-RS resources configured in each measurement object have the same center frequency, (startPRB+floor(nrofPRBs/2))
-	to ensure that the total number of CSI-RS resources configured in each measurement object does not exceed the maximum number specified in TS 38.214 [19].

If smtc3list is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in each SSB-MTC3 element of the list in the same MeasObjectNR, the IAB-MT shall setup an additional SS block measurement timing configuration in accordance with the received periodicityAndOffset parameter (using same condition as smtc1 to identify the SFN and the subframe for SMTC occasion) in each SSB-MTC3 configuration and use the duration and ssb-ToMeasure parameters from each SSB-MTC3 configuration.
On the indicated ssbFrequency, the UE shall not consider SS/PBCH block transmission in subframes outside the SMTC occasion for RRM measurements based on SS/PBCH blocks and for RRM measurements based on CSI-RS except for SFTD measurement (see TS 38.133 [14], subclause 9.3.8).
5.5.2.10a	RSSI measurement timing configuration
The UE shall setup the RSSI measurement timing configuration (RMTC) in accordance with the received rmtc-Periodicity and, if configured, with rmtc-SubframeOffset i.e. the first symbol of each RMTC occasion occurs at first symbol of an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the following condition:
SFN mod T = FLOOR(rmtc-SubframeOffset/10);
subframe = rmtc-SubframeOffset mod 10;
with T = rmtc-Periodicity/10;
On the frequency configured by rmtc-Frequency, the UE shall not consider RSSI measurements outside the configured RMTC occasion which lasts for measDurationSymbols for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements.
The UE derives the RSSI measurement duration from a combination of measDurationSymbols and ref-SCS-CP. At least for RSSI measurement confined within the active DL BWP, the UE performs RSSI measurement using the numerology of the active DL BWP during the derived measurement duration. Otherwise, the numerology used by the UE for measurements is up to UE implementation.

5.5.3	Performing measurements
5.5.3.1	General
An RRC_CONNECTED UE shall derive cell measurement results by measuring one or multiple beams associated per cell as configured by the network, as described in 5.5.3.3. For all cell measurement results, except for RSSI, and CLI measurement results in RRC_CONNECTED, the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2, before using the measured results for evaluation of reporting criteria, measurement reporting or the criteria to trigger conditional reconfiguration execution. For cell measurements, the network can configure RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, RSCP or EcN0 as trigger quantity. For CLI measurements, the network can configure SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI as trigger quantity. For cell and beam measurements, reporting quantities can be any combination of quantities (i.e. only RSRP; only RSRQ; only SINR; RSRP and RSRQ; RSRP and SINR; RSRQ and SINR; RSRP, RSRQ and SINR; only RSCP; only EcN0; RSCP and EcN0), irrespective of the trigger quantity, and for CLI measurements, reporting quantities can be either SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI. For conditional reconfiguration execution, the network can configure up to 2 quantities, both using same RS type. The UE does not apply the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 to derive the CBR measurements.
The network may also configure the UE to report measurement information per beam (which can either be measurement results per beam with respective beam identifier(s) or only beam identifier(s)), derived as described in 5.5.3.3a. If beam measurement information is configured to be included in measurement reports, the UE applies the layer 3 beam filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2. On the other hand, the exact L1 filtering of beam measurements used to derive cell measurement results is implementation dependent.

5.5.3.2	Layer 3 filtering
The UE shall:
1>	for each cell measurement quantity, each beam measurement quantity, each sidelink measurement quantity as needed in sub-clause 5.8.10, and for each CLI measurement quantity that the UE performs measurements according to 5.5.3.1:

	Fn = (1 – a)*Fn-1 + a*Mn
	where
Mn is the latest received measurement result from the physical layer;
Fn is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting;
Fn-1 is the old filtered measurement result, where F0 is set to M1 when the first measurement result from the physical layer is received; and for MeasObjectNR, a = 1/2(ki/4), where ki is the filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity of the i:th QuantityConfigNR in quantityConfigNR-List, and i is indicated by quantityConfigIndex in MeasObjectNR; for other measurements, a = 1/2(k/4), where k is the filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity received by the quantityConfig; for UTRA-FDD, a = 1/2(k/4), where k is the filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity received by quantityConfigUTRA-FDD in the QuantityConfig;
2>	adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are preserved at different input rates, observing that the filterCoefficient k assumes a sample rate equal to X ms; The value of X is equivalent to one intra-frequency L1 measurement period as defined in TS 38.133 [14] assuming non-DRX operation, and depends on frequency range.
NOTE 1:	If k is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
NOTE 2:	The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e., logarithmic filtering for logarithmic measurements.
NOTE 3:	The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the performance requirements set in TS 38.133 [14]. For further details about the physical layer measurements, see TS 38.133 [14].
NOTE 4:	For CLI-RSSI measurement, it is up to UE implementation whether to reset filtering upon BWP switch.

5.5.6	Location measurement indication
5.5.6.1	General

Figure 5.5.5.1-1: Location measurement indication
The purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE is going to start/stop location related measurements towards E-UTRA or NR (eutra-RSTD, nr-RSTD, nr-UE-RxTxTimeDiff, nr-PRS-RSRP) which require measurement gaps or start/stop detection of subframe and slot timing towards E-UTRA (eutra-FineTimingDetection) which requires measurement gaps. UE shall initiate this procedure only after successful AS security activation.
NOTE:	It is a network decision to configure the measurement gap.
5.5.6.2	Initiation
The UE shall:
1>	if and only if upper layers indicate to start performing location measurements towards E-UTRA or NR or start subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA, and the UE requires measurement gaps for these operations while measurement gaps are either not configured or not sufficient:
2>	initiate the procedure to indicate start;
NOTE 1:	The UE verifies the measurement gap situation only upon receiving the indication from upper layers. If at this point in time sufficient gaps are available, the UE does not initiate the procedure. Unless it receives a new indication from upper layers, the UE is only allowed to further repeat the procedure in the same PCell once per frequency of the target RAT if the provided measurement gaps are insufficient.
1>	if and only if upper layers indicate to stop performing location measurements towards E-UTRA or NR or stop subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA:

5.6	UE capabilities
5.6.1	UE capability transfer
5.6.1.1	General
This clause describes how the UE compiles and transfers its UE capability information upon receiving a UECapabilityEnquiry from the network.

Figure 5.6.1.1-1: UE capability transfer
5.6.1.2	Initiation
The network initiates the procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED when it needs (additional) UE radio access capability information. The network should retrieve UE capabilities only after AS security activation. Network does not forward UE capabilities that were retrieved before AS security activation to the CN.
5.6.1.3	Reception of the UECapabilityEnquiry by the UE
The UE shall set the contents of UECapabilityInformation message as follows:
1>	if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to nr:
2>	include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a UE-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-NR-Capability and with the rat-Type set to nr;
2>	include the supportedBandCombinationList, featureSets and featureSetCombinations as specified in clause 5.6.1.4;

2> if the UE supports (NG)EN-DC or NE-DC:
3>	include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a UE-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-MRDC-Capability and with the rat-Type set to eutra-nr;

2>	if the UE supports E-UTRA:
3>	include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a ue-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-EUTRA-Capability and with the rat-Type set to eutra as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.3.3, according to the capabilityRequestFilter, if received;

2>	if the UE supports UTRA-FDD:
3>	include the UE radio access capabilities for UTRA-FDD within a ue-CapabilityRAT-Container and with the rat-Type set to utra-fdd;
1>	if the RRC message segmentation is enabled based on the field rrc-SegAllowed received, and the encoded RRC message is larger than the maximum supported size of a PDCP SDU specified in TS 38.323 [5]:
2>	initiate the UL message segment transfer procedure as specified in clause 5.7.7;
1>	else:
2>	submit the UECapabilityInformation message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
5.6.1.4	Setting band combinations, feature set combinations and feature sets supported by the UE
The UE invokes the procedures in this clause if the NR or E-UTRA network requests UE capabilities for nr, eutra-nr or eutra. This procedure is invoked once per requested rat-Type (see clause 5.6.1.3 for capability enquiry by the NR network; see TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.3.3 for capability enquiry by the E-UTRA network). The UE shall ensure that the feature set IDs are consistent across feature sets, feature set combinations and band combinations in all three UE capability containers that the network queries with the same fields with the same values, i.e. UE-CapabilityRequestFilterNR, UE-CapabilityRequestFilterCommon and fields in UECapabilityEnquiry message (i.e. requestedFreqBandsNR-MRDC, requestedCapabilityNR, eutra-nr-only flag, and requestedCapabilityCommon) as defined in TS 36.331, where applicable.
NOTE 1:	Capability enquiry without frequencyBandListFilter is not supported.
NOTE 2:	In EN-DC, the gNB needs the capabilities for RAT types nr and eutra-nr and it uses the featureSets in the UE-NR-Capability together with the featureSetCombinations in the UE-MRDC-Capability to determine the NR UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Similarly, the eNB needs the capabilities for RAT types eutra and eutra-nr and it uses the featureSetsEUTRA in the UE-EUTRA-Capability together with the featureSetCombinations in the UE-MRDC-Capability to determine the E-UTRA UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Hence, the IDs used in the featureSets must match the IDs referred to in featureSetCombinations across all three containers. The requirement on consistency implies that there are no undefined feature sets and feature set combinations.
NOTE 3:	If the UE cannot include all feature sets and feature set combinations due to message size or list size constraints, it is up to UE implementation which feature sets and feature set combinations it prioritizes.
The UE shall:
1>	compile a list of "candidate band combinations" according to the filter criteria in capabilityRequestFilterCommon (if included), only consisting of bands included in frequencyBandListFilter, and prioritized in the order of frequencyBandListFilter (i.e. first include band combinations containing the first-listed band, then include remaining band combinations containing the second-listed band, and so on), where for each band in the band combination, the parameters of the band do not exceed maxBandwidthRequestedDL, maxBandwidthRequestedUL, maxCarriersRequestedDL, maxCarriersRequestedUL, ca-BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA or ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA, whichever are received;
1>	for each band combination included in the list of "candidate band combinations":
2>	if the network (E-UTRA) included the eutra-nr-only field, or
2>	if the requested rat-Type is eutra:
3>	remove the NR-only band combination from the list of "candidate band combinations";
NOTE 4:	The (E-UTRA) network may request capabilities for nr but indicate with the eutra-nr-only flag that the UE shall not include any NR band combinations in the UE-NR-Capability. In this case the procedural text above removes all NR-only band combinations from the candidate list and thereby also avoids inclusion of corresponding feature set combinations and feature sets below.
2>	if it is regarded as a fallback band combination with the same capabilities of another band combination included in the list of "candidate band combinations", and
2>	if this fallback band combination is generated by releasing at least one SCell or uplink configuration of SCell or SUL according to TS 38.306 [26]:
3>	remove the band combination from the list of "candidate band combinations";
NOTE 5:	Even if the network requests (only) capabilities for nr, it may include E-UTRA band numbers in the frequencyBandListFilter to ensure that the UE includes all necessary feature sets needed for subsequently requested eutra-nr capabilities. At this point of the procedure the list of "candidate band combinations" contains all NR- and/or E-UTRA-NR band combinations that match the filter (frequencyBandListFilter) provided by the NW and that match the eutra-nr-only flag (if RAT-Type nr is requested by E-UTRA). In the following, this candidate list is used to derive the band combinations, feature set combinations and feature sets to be reported in the requested capability container.
1>	if the requested rat-Type is nr:
2>	include into supportedBandCombinationList as many NR-only band combinations as possible from the list of "candidate band combinations", starting from the first entry;
3>	if srs-SwitchingTimeRequest is received:
4>	if SRS carrier switching is supported;
5>	include srs-SwitchingTimesListNR for each band combination;
4>	set srs-SwitchingTimeRequested to true;
2>	include, into featureSetCombinations, the feature set combinations referenced from the supported band combinations as included in supportedBandCombinationList according to the previous;

NOTE 1:	The term "IDC problems" refers to interference issues applicable across several subframes/slots where not necessarily all the subframes/slots are affected.
NOTE 2:	For the frequencies on which a serving cell or serving cells is configured that is activated, IDC problems consist of interference issues that the UE cannot solve by itself, during either active data exchange or upcoming data activity which is expected in up to a few hundred milliseconds.
For frequencies on which a SCell or SCells is configured that is deactivated, reporting IDC problems indicates an anticipation that the activation of the SCell or SCells would result in interference issues that the UE would not be able to solve by itself.
For a non-serving frequency, reporting IDC problems indicates an anticipation that if the non-serving frequency or frequencies became a serving frequency or serving frequencies then this would result in interference issues that the UE would not be able to solve by itself.

5.8	Sidelink
5.8.1	General
NR sidelink communication consists of unicast, groupcast and broadcast. For unicast, the PC5-RRC connection is a logical connection between a pair of a Source Layer-2 ID and a Destination Layer-2 ID in the AS. The PC5-RRC signalling, as specified in sub-clause 5.8.9, can be initiated after its corresponding PC5 unicast link establishment (TS 23.287 [55]). The PC5-RRC connection and the corresponding sidelink SRBs and sidelink DRB(s) are released when the PC5 unicast link is released as indicated by upper layers.
For each PC5-RRC connection of unicast, one sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB0) is used to transmit the PC5-S message(s) before the PC5-S security has been established. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB1) is used to transmit the PC5-S messages to establish the PC5-S security. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB2) is used to transmit the PC5-S messages after the PC5-S security has been established, which is protected. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB3) is used to transmit the PC5-RRC signalling, which is protected and only sent after the PC5-S security has been established.
For unicast of NR sidelink communication, AS security comprises of integrity protection of PC5 signalling (SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3) and user data (SL-DRBs), and it further comprises of ciphering of PC5 signaling (SL-SRB1 only for the Direct Link Security Mode Complete message as specified in TS 24.587[57], SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3) and user data (SL-DRBs). The ciphering and integrity protection algorithms and parameters for a PC5 unicast link are exchanged by PC5-S messages in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536 [60], and apply to the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in the AS. Once AS security is activated for a PC5 unicast link in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536 [60], all messages on SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3 and/or user data on SL-DRBs of the corresponding PC5-RRC connection are integrity protected and/or ciphered by the PDCP.
For unicast of NR sidelink communication, if the change of the key is indicated by the upper layers as specified in TS 24.587 [57], UE re-establishes the PDCP entity of the SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2, SL-SRB3 and SL-DRBs on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection.
NOTE 1:	In case the configurations for NR sidelink communication are acquired via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in SIB12 and sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration used in subclause 5.8 are provided by the configurations in SystemInformationBlockType28 and sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR within RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331 [10], respectively.
NOTE 2:	In this release, there is one-to-one correspondence between the PC5-RRC connection and the PC5 unicast link as specified in TS 38.300[2].
NOTE 3:	All SL-DRBs related to the same PC5-RRC connection have the same activation/deactivation setting for ciphering and the same activation/deactivation setting for integrity protection as in TS 33.536 [60].
NOTE 4:	When integrity check failure concerning SL-SRB1 for a specific destination is detected, the UE sends an indication to the upper layers [57].
5.8.2	Conditions for NR sidelink communication operation
The UE shall perform NR sidelink communication operation only if the conditions defined in this clause are met:
1>	if the UE's serving cell is suitable (RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED); and if either the selected cell on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication operation belongs to the registered or equivalent PLMN as specified in TS 24.587 [57] or the UE is out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication operation as defined in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 36.304 [27]; or
1>	if the UE's serving cell (RRC_IDLE or RRC_CONNECTED) fulfils the conditions to support NR sidelink communication in limited service state as specified in TS 23.287 [55]; and if either the serving cell is on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication operation or the UE is out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication operation as defined in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 36.304 [27]; or
1>	if the UE has no serving cell (RRC_IDLE);

5.8.9.4	Sidelink common control information
5.8.9.4.1	General

5.8.10	Sidelink measurement
5.8.10.1	Introduction
The UE may configure the associated peer UE to peform NR sidelink measurement and report on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in accordance with the NR sidelink measurement configuration for unicast by RRCReconfigurationSidelink message.
The NR sidelink measurement configuration includes the following parameters for a PC5-RRC connection:
1.	NR sidelink measurement objects: Object(s) on which the associated peer UE shall perform the NR sidelink measurements.
-	For NR sidelink measurement, a NR sidelink measurement object indicates the NR sidelink frequency of reference signals to be measured.
2.	NR sidelink reporting configurations: NR sidelink measurement reporting configuration(s) where there can be one or multiple NR sidelink reporting configurations per NR sidelink measurement object. Each NR sidelink reporting configuration consists of the following:
-	Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a NR sidelink measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event description.
-	RS type: The RS that the UE uses for NR sidelink measurement results. In this release, only DMRS is supported for NR sidelink measurement.
-	Reporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement report. In this release, only RSRP measurement is supported.
3.	NR sidelink measurement identities: A list of NR sidelink measurement identities where each NR sidelink measurement identity links one NR sidelink measurement object with one NR sidelink reporting configuration. By configuring multiple NR sidelink measurement identities, it is possible to link more than one NR sidelink measurement object to the same NR sidelink reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one NR sidelink reporting configuration to the same NR sidelink measurement object. The NR sidelink measurement identity is also included in the NR sidelink measurement report that triggered the reporting, serving as a reference to the network.
4.	NR sidelink quantity configurations: The NR sidelink quantity configuration defines the NR sidelink measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and related reporting, and for periodical reporting of that NR sidelink measurement. In each configuration, different filter coefficients can be configured for different NR sidelink measurement quantities.
Both UEs of the PC5-RRC connection maintains a NR sidelink measurement object list, a NR sidelink reporting configuration list, and a NR sidelink measurement identities list according to signalling and procedures in this specification.

Ms + Hys < Thresh
The variables in the formula are defined as follows:
Ms is the NR sidelink measurement result of the NR sidelink frequency, not taking into account any offsets.

Hys is expressed in dB.
Thresh is expressed in the same unit as Ms.
5.8.10.4.3	Event S2 (Serving becomes worse than threshold)
The UE shall:
1>	consider the entering condition for this event to be satisfied when condition S2-1, as specified below, is fulfilled;

5.8.10.5	Sidelink measurement reporting
5.8.10.5.1	General

Figure 5.8.10.5.1-1: NR sidelink measurement reporting
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer measurement results from the UE to the peer UE associated.
For the sl-MeasId for which the NR sidelink measurement reporting procedure was triggered, the UE shall set the sl-MeasResults within the MeasurementReportSidelink message as follows:
1>	set the sl-MeasId to the measurement identity that triggered the NR sidelink measurement reporting;
1>	if the sl-ReportConfig associated with the sl-MeasId that triggered the NR sidelink measurement reporting is set to sl-EventTriggered or sl-Periodical:
2>	set sl-ResultDMRS within sl-MeasResult to include the NR sidelink DMRS based quantity indicated in the sl-ReportQuantity within the concerned sl-ReportConfig;
1>	increment the sl-NumberOfReportsSent as defined within the VarMeasReportListSSL for this sl-MeasId by 1;
1>	stop the periodical reporting timer, if running;
1>	if the sl-NumberOfReportsSent as defined within the VarMeasReportListSL for this sl-MeasId is less than the sl-ReportAmount as defined within the corresponding sl-ReportConfig for this sl-MeasId:
2>	start the periodical reporting timer with the value of sl-ReportInterval as defined within the corresponding sl-ReportConfig for this sl-MeasId;

2>	if the sl-ReportType is set to sl-Periodical:
3>	remove the entry within the VarMeasReportListSL for this sl-MeasId;
3>	remove this sl-MeasId from the sl-MeasIdList within VarMeasConfigSL;
1>	submit the MeasurementReportSidelink message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
5.8.11	Zone identity calculation
The UE shall determine an identity of the zone (i.e. Zone_id) in which it is located using the following formulae, if sl-ZoneConfig is configured:
x1= Floor (x / L) Mod 64;
y1= Floor (y / L) Mod 64;
Zone_id = y1 * 64 + x1.
The parameters in the formulae are defined as follows:
L is the value of sl-ZoneLength included in sl-ZoneConfig;
x is the geodesic distance in longitude between UE's current location and geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [58] and it is expressed in meters;
y is the geodesic distance in latitude between UE's current location and geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [58] and it is expressed in meters.
NOTE:	How the calculated zone_id is used is specified in TS 38.321 [3].
5.8.12	DFN derivation from GNSS
When the UE selects GNSS as the synchronization reference source, the DFN, the subframe number within a frame and slot number within a frame used for NR sidelink communication are derived from the current UTC time, by the following formulae:
DFN= Floor (0.1*(Tcurrent –Tref–OffsetDFN)) mod 1024
SubframeNumber= Floor (Tcurrent –Tref–OffsetDFN) mod 10
SlotNumber= Floor ((Tcurrent –Tref–OffsetDFN)*2μ) mod (10*2μ)
Where:
Tcurrent is the current UTC time obtained from GNSS. This value is expressed in milliseconds;
Tref is the reference UTC time 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1 January, 1900 (midnight between Thursday, December 31, 1899 and Friday, January 1, 1900). This value is expressed in milliseconds;
OffsetDFN is the value sl-OffsetDFN if configured, otherwise it is zero. This value is expressed in milliseconds.
μ=0/1/2/3 corresponding to the 15/30/60/120 kHz of SCS for SL, respectively.
NOTE 1:	In case of leap second change event, how UE obtains the scheduled time of leap second change to adjust Tcurrent correspondingly is left to UE implementation. How UE handles to avoid the sudden discontinuity of DFN is left to UE implementation.
NOTE 2:	Void.
6	Protocol data units, formats and parameters (ASN.1)
6.1	General
6.1.1	Introduction
The contents of each RRC message is specified in sub-clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further detailed information about the fields specified in the message syntax. The syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone abstract types is further specified in a similar manner in sub-clause 6.3.
Usage of the text "Network always configures the UE with a value for this field" in the field description indicates that the network has to provide a value for the field in this or in a previous message based on delta configuration (for an optional field with Need M). It does not imply a mandatory presence of the field.
6.1.2	Need codes and conditions for optional downlink fields
The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available for use in the downlink direction only. The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1.2-1.
If conditions are used, a conditional presence table is provided for the message or information element specifying the need of the field for each condition case. The table also specifies whether UE maintains or releases the value in case the field is absent. The conditions clarify what the UE may expect regarding the setting of the message by the network. Violation of conditions is regarded as invalid network behaviour, which the UE is not required to cope with. Hence the general error handling defined in 10.4 does not apply in case a field is absent although it is mandatory according to the CondC or CondM condition.
For guidelines on the use of need codes and conditions, see Annex A.6 and A.7.
Table 6.1.2-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields to be present
Abbreviation
Meaning
Cond conditionTag
Conditionally present
Presence of the field is specified in a tabular form following the ASN.1 segment.
CondC conditionTag
Configuration condition
Presence of the field is conditional to other configuration settings.
CondM conditionTag
Message condition
Presence of the field is conditional to other fields included in the message.
Need S
Specified
Used for (configuration) fields, whose field description or procedure specifies the UE behavior performed upon receiving a message with the field absent (and not if field description or procedure specifies the UE behavior when field is not configured).
Need M
Maintain
Used for (configuration) fields that are stored by the UE i.e. not one-shot. Upon receiving a message with the field absent, the UE maintains the current value.
Need N
No action (one-shot configuration that is not maintained)
Used for (configuration) fields that are not stored and whose presence causes a one-time action by the UE. Upon receiving message with the field absent, the UE takes no action.
Need R
Release
Used for (configuration) fields that are stored by the UE i.e. not one-shot. Upon receiving a message with the field absent, the UE releases the current value.
NOTE:	In this version of the specification, the condition tags CondC and CondM are not used.
Any field with Need M or Need N in system information shall be interpreted as Need R.
The need code used within a CondX definition only applies for the case (part of the condition) where it is defined: A condition may have different need codes for different parts of the condition. In particular, the CondX definition may contain the following "otherwise the field is absent" parts:
-	"Otherwise, the field is absent": The field is not relevant or should not be configured when this part of the condition applies. In particular, the UE behaviour is not defined when the field is configured via another part of the condition and is reconfigured to this part of the condition. A need code is not provided when the transition from another part of the condition to this part of the condition is not supported, when the field clearly is a one-shot or there is no difference whether UE maintains or releases the value (e.g., in case the field is mandatory present according to the other part of the condition).
-	"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need R": The field is released if absent when this part of the condition applies. This handles UE behaviour in case the field is configured via another part of the condition and this part of the condition applies (which means that network can assume UE releases the field if this part of the condition is valid).
-	"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need M": The UE retains the field if it was already configured when this part of the condition applies. This means the network cannot release the field , but UE retains the previously configured value.
Use of different Need codes in different parts of a condition should be avoided.
For downlink messages, the need codes, conditions and ASN.1 defaults specified for a particular (child) field only apply in case the (parent) field including the particular field is present. Thus, if the parent is absent the UE shall not release the field unless the absence of the parent field implies that.
For (parent) fields without need codes in downlink messages, if the parent field is absent, UE shall follow the need codes of the child fields. Thus, if parent field is absent, the need code of each child field is followed (i.e. Need R child fields are released, Need M child fields are not modified and the actions for Need S child fields depend on the specified conditions of each field). Examples of (parent) fields in downlink messages without need codes where this rule applies are:
-	nonCriticalExtension fields at the end of a message using empty SEQUENCE extension mechanism,
-	groups of non-critical extensions using double brackets (referred to as extension groups), and
-	non-critical extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a structure, contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent extension fields).
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.

-- ASN1STOP

The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:
-	if field1 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE does not modify any child fields configured within field1 (regardless of their need codes);
-	if field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE releases the field2 (and also its child field field21);
-	if field1 or field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is present, UE retains or releases their child fields according to the child field presence conditions;
-	if field1 in RRCMessage-IEs is present but the extension group containing field13 and field14 is absent, the UE releases field13 but does not modify field14;
-	if nonCriticalExtension defined by IE RRCMessage-v1570-IEs is absent, the UE does not modify field3 but releases field4;
6.1.3	General rules
In the ASN.1 of this specification, the first bit of a bit string refers to the leftmost bit, unless stated otherwise.
Upon reception of a list not using ToAddModList and ToReleaseList structure, the UE shall delete all entries of the list currently in the UE configuration before applying the received list and shall consider each entry as newly created. This applies also to lists whose size is extended (i.e. with a second list structure in the ASN.1 comprising additional entries), unless otherwise specified. This implies that Need M should not be used for fields in the entries of these lists; if used, UE will handle such fields equivalent to a Need R.

DLDedicatedMessageSegment field descriptions
segmentNumber
Identifies the sequence number of a segment within the encoded DL DCCH message. The network transmits the segments with continuously increasing segmentNumber order so that the UE's RRC layer may expect to obtain them from lower layers in the correct order. Hence, the UE is not required to perform segment re-ordering on RRC level.
rrc-MessageSegmentContainer
Includes a segment of the encoded DL DCCH message. The size of the included segment in this container should be small enough so the resulting encoded RRC message PDU is less than or equal to the PDCP SDU size limit.
rrc-MessageSegmentType
Indicates whether the included DL DCCH message segment is the last segment of the message or not.

MIB field descriptions
cellBarred
Value barred means that the cell is barred, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT.
dmrs-TypeA-Position
Position of (first) DM-RS for downlink (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.1.2) and uplink (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3).
intraFreqReselection
Controls cell selection/reselection to intra-frequency cells when the highest ranked cell is barred, or treated as barred by the UE, as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT.
pdcch-ConfigSIB1
Determines a common ControlResourceSet (CORESET), a common search space and necessary PDCCH parameters. If the field ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates that SIB1 is absent, the field pdcch-ConfigSIB1 indicates the frequency positions where the UE may find SS/PBCH block with SIB1 or the frequency range where the network does not provide SS/PBCH block with SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13).
ssb-SubcarrierOffset
Corresponds to kSSB (see TS 38.213 [13]), which is the frequency domain offset between SSB and the overall resource block grid in number of subcarriers. (See TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.3.1). For operation with shared spectrum channel access (see 37.213 [48]), this field corresponds to , and kSSB is obtained from  (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.3.1); the LSB of this field is used also for deriving the QCL relation between SS/PBCH blocks as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
The value range of this field may be extended by an additional most significant bit encoded within PBCH as specified in TS 38.213 [13].
This field may indicate that this cell does not provide SIB1 and that there is hence no CORESET#0 configured in MIB (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). In this case, the field pdcch-ConfigSIB1 may indicate the frequency positions where the UE may (not) find a SS/PBCH with a control resource set and search space for SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13).
subCarrierSpacingCommon
Subcarrier spacing for SIB1, Msg.2/4 and MsgB for initial access, paging and broadcast SI-messages. If the UE acquires this MIB on an FR1 carrier frequency, the value scs15or60 corresponds to 15 kHz and the value scs30or120 corresponds to 30 kHz. If the UE acquires this MIB on an FR2 carrier frequency, the value scs15or60 corresponds to 60 kHz and the value scs30or120 corresponds to 120 kHz. For operation with shared spectrum channel access (see 37.213 [48]), the subcarrier spacing for SIB1, Msg.2/4 and MsgB for initial access, paging and broadcast SI-messages is same as that for the corresponding SSB and this field instead is used for deriving the QCL relation between SS/PBCH blocks as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
systemFrameNumber
The 6 most significant bits (MSB) of the 10-bit System Frame Number (SFN). The 4 LSB of the SFN are conveyed in the PBCH transport block as part of channel coding (i.e. outside the MIB encoding), as defined in clause 7.1 in TS 38.212 [17].

Indicates the BAP address of an IAB-node. The BAP address of an IAB-node cannot be changed once configured to the BAP entity.
conditionalReconfiguration
Configuration of candidate target SpCell(s) and execution condition(s) for conditional handover or conditional PSCell change. For conditional PSCell change, this field may only be present in an RRCReconfiguration message for intra-SN PSCell change. The network does not configure a UE with both conditional PCell change and conditional PSCell change simultaneously. The field is absent if any DAPS bearer is configured or if the masterCellGroup includes ReconfigurationWithSync. For conditional PSCell change, the field is absent if the secondaryCellGroup includes ReconfigurationWithSync. The RRCReconfiguration message contained in DLInformationTransferMRDC cannot contain the field conditionalReconfiguration for conditional PSCell change.
daps-SourceRelease
Indicates to UE that the source cell part of DAPS operation is to be stopped and the source cell part of DAPS configuration is to be released.
dedicatedNAS-MessageList
This field is used to transfer UE specific NAS layer information between the network and the UE. The RRC layer is transparent for each PDU in the list. 
dedicatedPosSysInfoDelivery
This field is used to transfer SIBPos to the UE in RRC_CONNECTED.
dedicatedSIB1-Delivery
This field is used to transfer SIB1 to the UE. The field has the same values as the corresponding configuration in servingCellConfigCommon.
dedicatedSystemInformationDelivery
This field is used to transfer SIB6, SIB7, SIB8 to the UE with an active BWP with no common serach space configured. For UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, this field is used to transfer the SIBs requested on-demand.
defaultUL-BAP-RoutingID
This field is used for IAB-node to configure the default uplink Routing ID, which is used by IAB-node during IAB-node bootstrapping, migration, IAB-MT RRC resume and IAB-MT RRC re-establishment for F1-C and non-F1 traffic. The defaultUL-BAP-RoutingID can be (re-)configured when IAB-node IP address for F1-C related traffic changes. This field is mandatory only for IAB-node bootstrapping.
defaultUL-BH-RLC-Channel
This field is used for IAB-nodes to configure the default uplink BH RLC channel, which is used by IAB-node during IAB-node bootstrapping, migration, IAB-MT RRC resume and IAB-MT RRC re-establishment for F1-C and non-F1 traffic. The defaultUL-BH-RLC-Channel can be (re-)configured when IAB-node IP address for F1-C related traffic changes, and the new IP address is anchored at a different IAB-donor-DU. This field is mandatory for IAB-node bootstrapping. If the IAB-MT is operating in EN-DC, the default uplink BH RLC channel is referring to an RLC channel on the SCG; Otherwise, it is referring to an RLC channel on the MCG.
flowControlFeedbackType
This field is only used for IAB-node that support hop-by-hop flow control to configure the type of flow control feedback. Value perBH-RLC-Channel indicates that the IAB-node shall provide flow control feedback per BH RLC channel, value perRoutingID indicates that the IAB-node shall provide flow control feedback per routing ID, and value both indicates that the IAB-node shall provide flow control feedback both per BH RLC channel and per routing ID.
fullConfig
Indicates that the full configuration option is applicable for the RRCReconfiguration message for intra-system intra-RAT HO. For inter-RAT HO from E-UTRA to NR, fullConfig indicates whether or not delta signalling of SDAP/PDCP from source RAT is applicable. This field is absent if any DAPS bearer is configured or when the RRCReconfiguration message is transmitted on SRB3, and in an RRCReconfiguration message for SCG contained in another RRCReconfiguration message (or RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, see TS 36.331 [10]) transmitted on SRB1.
iab-IP-Address
This field is used to provide the IP address information for IAB-node.
iab-IP-AddressIndex
This field is used to identify a configuration of an IP address.
iab-IP-AddressToAddModList
List of IP addresses allocated for IAB-node to be added and modified.
iab-IP-AddressToReleaseList
List of IP address allocated for IAB-node to be released.
iab-IP-Usage
This field is used to indicate the usage of the assigned IP address. If this field is not configured, the assigned IP address is used for all traffic.
iab-donor-DU-BAP-Address
This field is used to indicate the BAP address of the IAB-donor-DU where the IP address is anchored.
keySetChangeIndicator
Indicates whether UE shall derive a new KgNB. If reconfigurationWithSync is included, value true indicates that a KgNB key is derived from a KAMF key taken into use through the latest successful NAS SMC procedure, or N2 handover procedure with KAMF change, as described in TS 33.501 [11] for KgNB re-keying. Value false indicates that the new KgNB key is obtained from the current KgNB key or from the NH as described in TS 33.501 [11].
masterCellGroup
Configuration of master cell group.
mrdc-ReleaseAndAdd
This field indicates that the current SCG configuration is released and a new SCG is added at the same time.
mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup
Includes an RRC message for SCG configuration in NR-DC or NE-DC.
For NR-DC (nr-SCG), mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup contains the RRCReconfiguration message as generated (entirely) by SN gNB. In this version of the specification, the RRC message can only include fields secondaryCellGroup, otherConfig, conditionalReconfiguration and measConfig.
For NE-DC (eutra-SCG), mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup includes the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. In this version of the specification, the E-UTRA RRC message can only include the field scg-Configuration.
nas-Container
This field is used to transfer UE specific NAS layer information between the network and the UE. The RRC layer is transparent for this field, although it affects activation of AS  security after inter-system handover to NR. The content is defined in TS 24.501 [23].
needForGapsConfigNR
Configuration for the UE to report measurement gap requirement information of NR target bands in the RRCReconfigurationComplete and RRCResumeComplete message.
nextHopChainingCount
Parameter NCC: See TS 33.501 [11]
onDemandSIB-Request
If the field is present, the UE is allowed to request SIB(s) on-demand while in RRC_CONNECTED according to clause 5.2.2.3.5.
onDemandSIB-RequestProhibitTimer
Prohibit timer for requesting SIB(s) on-demand while in RRC_CONNECTED according to clause 5.2.2.3.5. Value in seconds. Value s0 means prohibit timer is set to 0 seconds, value s0dot5 means prohibit timer is set to 0.5 seconds, value s1 means prohibit timer is set to 1 second and so on.
otherConfig
Contains configuration related to other configurations. When configured for the SCG, only fields drx-PreferenceConfig, maxBW-PreferenceConfig, maxCC-PreferenceConfig, maxMIMO-LayerPreferenceConfig, minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceConfig, btNameList, wlanNameList, sensorNameList and obtainCommonLocation can be included.
radioBearerConfig
Configuration of Radio Bearers (DRBs, SRBs) including SDAP/PDCP. In EN-DC this field may only be present if the RRCReconfiguration is transmitted over SRB3.
radioBearerConfig2
Configuration of Radio Bearers (DRBs, SRBs) including SDAP/PDCP. This field can only be used if the UE supports NR-DC or NE-DC.
secondaryCellGroup
Configuration of secondary cell group ((NG)EN-DC or NR-DC).
sk-Counter
A counter used upon initial configuration of S-KgNB or S-KeNB, as well as upon refresh of S-KgNB or S-KeNB. This field is always included either upon initial configuration of an NR SCG or upon configuration of the first RB with keyToUse set to secondary, whichever happens first. This field is absent if there is neither any NR SCG nor any RB with keyToUse set to secondary.
sl-ConfigDedicatedNR
This field is used to provide the dedicated configurations for NR sidelink communication.
sl-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA-Info
This field includes the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. In this version of the specification, the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration can only includes sidelink related fields for V2X sidelink communication, i.e. sl-V2X-ConfigDedicated, sl-V2X-SPS-Config, measConfig and/or otherConfig.
sl-TimeOffsetEUTRA
This field indicates the possible time offset to (de)activation of V2X sidelink transmission after receiving DCI format 3_1 used for scheduling V2X sidelink communication. Value ms0dpt75 corresponds to 0.75ms, ms1 corresponds to 1ms and so on. The network includes this field only when sl-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA is configured.
targetCellSMTC-SCG
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR PSCell addition and SN change. When UE receives this field, UE applies the configuration based on the timing reference of NR PCell for PSCell addition and PSCell change for the case of no reconfiguration with sync of MCG, and UE applies the configuration based on the timing reference of target NR PCell for the case of reconfiguration with sync of MCG. If both this field and the smtc in secondaryCellGroup -> SpCellConfig -> reconfigurationWithSync are absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.
t316
Indicates the value for timer T316 as described in clause 7.1. Value ms50 corresponds to 50 ms, value ms100 corresponds to 100 ms and so on. This field can be configured only if the UE is configured with split SRB1 or SRB3.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
nonHO
The field is absent in case of reconfiguration with sync within NR or to NR; otherwise it is optionally present, need N.
securityNASC
This field is mandatory present in case of inter system handover. Otherwise the field is optionally present, need N.
MasterKeyChange
This field is mandatory present in case masterCellGroup includes ReconfigurationWithSync and RadioBearerConfig includes SecurityConfig with SecurityAlgorithmConfig, indicating a change of the AS security algorithms associated to the master key. If ReconfigurationWithSync is included for other cases, this field is optionally present, need N. Otherwise the field is absent.
FullConfig
The field is mandatory present in case of inter-system handover from E-UTRA/EPC to NR. It is optionally present, Need N, during reconfiguration with sync and also in first reconfiguration after reestablishment; or for intra-system handover from E-UTRA/5GC to NR. It is absent otherwise.

RRCRelease-IEs field descriptions
cnType
Indicate that the UE is redirected to EPC or 5GC.
deprioritisationReq
Indicates whether the current frequency or RAT is to be de-prioritised.
deprioritisationTimer
Indicates the period for which either the current carrier frequency or NR is deprioritised. Value minN corresponds to N minutes.
measIdleConfig
Indicates measurement configuration to be stored and used by the UE while in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.
mpsPriorityIndication
Indicates the UE can set the establishment cause to mps-PriorityAccess for a new connection to a new RAT following a redirect to NR. If the target RAT is E-UTRA, see TS 36.331 [10]. The gNB sets the indication only for UEs authorized to receive MPS treatment as indicated by ARP and/or QoS characteristics at the gNB, and it is applicable only for this instance of release with redirection to carrier/RAT included in the redirectedCarrierInfo field in the RRCRelease message.
suspendConfig
Indicates configuration for the RRC_INACTIVE state. The network does not configure suspendConfig when the network redirect the UE to an inter-RAT carrier frequency or if the UE is configured with a DAPS bearer.
redirectedCarrierInfo
Indicates a carrier frequency (downlink for FDD) and is used to redirect the UE to an NR or an inter-RAT carrier frequency, by means of cell selection at transition to RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. Based on UE capability, the network may include redirectedCarrierInfo in RRCRelease message with suspendConfig if this message is sent in response to an RRCResumeRequest or an RRCResumeRequest1 which is triggered by the NAS layer (see 5.3.1.4 in TS 24.501 [23]).
voiceFallbackIndication
Indicates the RRC release is triggered by EPS fallback for IMS voice as specified in TS 23.502 [43].

CarrierInfoNR field descriptions
carrierFreq
Indicates the redirected NR frequency.
ssbSubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing of SSB in the redirected SSB frequency. Only the values 15 kHz or 30 kHz (FR1), and 120 kHz or 240 kHz (FR2) are applicable.
smtc
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration for the redirected SSB frequency. It is based on timing reference of PCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC configured in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing.

RAN-NotificationAreaInfo field descriptions

ran-AreaCodeList
The total number of RAN-AreaCodes of all PLMNs does not exceed 32.
ran-Area
Indicates whether TA code(s) or RAN area code(s) are used for the RAN notification area. The network uses only TA code(s) or both TA code(s) and RAN area code(s) to configure a UE. The total number of TACs across all PLMNs does not exceed 16.

PLMN-RAN-AreaCell field descriptions
plmn-Identity
PLMN Identity to which the cells in ran-AreaCells belong. If the field is absent the UE not in SNPN access mode uses the ID of the registered PLMN. This field is not included for UE in SNPN access mode (for UE in SNPN access mode the ran-AreaCells always belongs to the registered SNPN).

cellSelectionInfo
Parameters for cell selection related to the serving cell.
eCallOverIMS-Support
Indicates whether the cell supports eCall over IMS services as defined in TS 23.501 [32]. If absent, eCall over IMS is not supported by the network in the cell.
idleModeMeasurementsEUTRA
This field indicates that a UE that is configured for EUTRA idle/inactive measurements shall perform the measurements while camping in this cell and report availability of these measurements when establishing or resuming a connection in this cell. If absent, a UE is not required to perform EUTRA idle/inactive measurements.
idleModeMeasurementsNR
This field indicates that a UE that is configured for NR idle/inactive measurements shall perform the measurements while camping in this cell and report availability of these measurements when establishing or resuming a connection in this cell. If absent, a UE is not required to perform NR idle/inactive measurements.
ims-EmergencySupport
Indicates whether the cell supports IMS emergency bearer services for UEs in limited service mode. If absent, IMS emergency call is not supported by the network in the cell for UEs in limited service mode.
q-QualMin
Parameter "Qqualmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for serving cell. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of negative infinity for Qqualmin.  
q-QualMinOffset
Parameter "Qqualminoffset" in TS 38.304 [20]. Actual value Qqualminoffset = field value [dB]. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of 0 dB for Qqualminoffset. Affects the minimum required quality level in the cell.
q-RxLevMin
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for serving cell.
q-RxLevMinOffset
Parameter "Qrxlevminoffset" in TS 38.304 [20]. Actual value Qrxlevminoffset = field value * 2 [dB]. If absent, the UE applies the (default) value of 0 dB for Qrxlevminoffset. Affects the minimum required Rx level in the cell.
q-RxLevMinSUL
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for serving cell.
servingCellConfigCommon
Configuration of the serving cell.
uac-AccessCategory1-SelectionAssistanceInfo
Information used to determine whether Access Category 1 applies to the UE, as defined in TS 22.261 [25]. If plmnCommon is chosen, the UAC-AccessCategory1-SelectionAssistanceInfo is applicable to all the PLMNs and SNPNs in plmn-IdentityInfoList and npn-IdentityInfoList. If individualPLMNList is chosen, the 1st entry in the list corresponds to the first network within all of the PLMNs and SNPNs across the plmn-IdentityList and the npn-IdentityInfoList, the 2nd entry in the list corresponds to the second network within all of the PLMNs and SNPNs across the plmn-IdentityList and the npn-IdentityInfoList and so on. If uac-AC1-SelectAssistInfo-r16 is present, the UE shall ignore the uac-AccessCategory1-SelectionAssistanceInfo.
uac-AC1-SelectAssistInfo
Information used to determine whether Access Category 1 applies to the UE, as defined in TS 22.261 [25]. The 1st entry in the list corresponds to the first network within all of the PLMNs and SNPNs across the plmn-IdentityList and npn-IdentityInfoList, the 2nd entry in the list corresponds to the second network within all of the PLMNs and SNPNs across the plmn-IdentityList and the npn-IdentityInfoList and so on. Value notConfigured indicates that Access Category1 is not configured for the corresponding PLMN/SNPN.
uac-BarringForCommon
Common access control parameters for each access category. Common values are used for all PLMNs/SNPNs, unless overwritten by the PLMN/SNPN specific configuration provided in uac-BarringPerPLMN-List. The parameters are specified by providing an index to the set of configurations (uac-BarringInfoSetList). UE behaviour upon absence of this field is specified in clause 5.3.14.2.
ue-TimersAndConstants
Timer and constant values to be used by the UE. The cell operating as PCell always provides this field.
useFullResumeID
Indicates which resume identifier and Resume request message should be used. UE uses fullI-RNTI and RRCResumeRequest1 if the field is present, or shortI-RNTI and RRCResumeRequest if the field is absent.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
Standalone
The field is mandatory present in a cell that supports standalone operation, otherwise it is absent.

SidelinkUEinformationNR field descriptions
sl-RxInterestedFreqList
Indicates the index of frequency on which the UE is interested to receive NR sidelink communication. The value 1 corresponds to the frequency of first entry in sl-FreqInfoList broadcast in SIB12, the value 2 corresponds to the frequency of second entry in sl-FreqInfoList broadcast in SIB12 and so on. In this release, only value 1 can be included in the interested frequency list. 
sl-TxResourceReq
Paramters to request the transmisison resouces for NR sidelink communication to the network in the Sidelink UE Information report.

SL-TxResourceReq field descriptions
sl-CapabilityInformationSidelink
Includes the UECapabilityInformationSidelink message (which can be also included in ueCapabilityInformationSidelink-r16 in UECapabilityEnquirySidelink from peer UE) received from the peer UE.
sl-CastType
Indicates the cast type for the correponding destination for which to request the resource.
sl-DestinationIdentity
Indicates the destination for which the TX resource request and allocation from the network are concerned.
sl-QoS-InfoList
Includes the QoS profile of the sidelink QoS flow as specified in TS 23.287 [55]
sl-QoS-FlowIdentity
This identity uniquely identifies one sidelink QoS flow between the UE and the network in the scope of UE, which is unique for different destination and cast type.
sl-RLC-ModeIndication
This field indicates the RLC mode and optionally the related QoS profiles for the sidelink radio bearer, which has not been configured by the network and is initiated by another UE in unicast. The RLC mode for one sidelink radio bearer is aligned between UE and NW by the sl-QoS-FlowIdentity.
sl-TxInterestedFreqList
Each entry of this field indicates the index of frequency on which the UE is interested to transmit NR sidelink communication. The value 1 corresponds to the frequency of first entry in sl-FreqInfoList broadcast in SIB12, the value 2 corresponds to the frequency of second entry in sl-FreqInfoList broadcast in SIB12 and so on. In this release, only value 1 can be included in the interested frequency list. In this relase, only one entry can be included in the list.
sl-TypeTxSyncList
A list of synchronization reference used by the UE. The UE shall include the same number of entries, listed in the same order, as in sl-TxInterestedFreqList, i.e. one for each carrier freqeuncy included in sl-TxInterestedFreqList.

SL-Failure field descriptions
sl-DestinationIdentity
Indicates the destination for which the SL failure is reporting for unicast.
sl-Failure
Indicates the sidelink failure cause for the sidelink RLF (value rlf) and sidelink AS configuration failure (value configFailure) for the associated destination for unicast.

UEAssistanceInformation field descriptions
affectedCarrierFreqList
Indicates a list of NR carrier frequencies that are affected by IDC problem.
affectedCarrierFreqCombList
Indicates a list of NR carrier frequencie combinations that are affected by IDC problems due to Inter-Modulation Distortion and harmonics from NR when configured with UL CA.
delayBudgetReport
Indicates the UE-preferred adjustment to connected mode DRX.
interferenceDirection
Indicates the direction of IDC interference. Value nr indicates that only NR is victim of IDC interference, value other indicates that only another radio is victim of IDC interference and value both indicates that both NR and another radio are victims of IDC interference. The other radio refers to either the ISM radio or GNSS (see TR 36.816 [44]).
minSchedulingOffsetPreference
Indicates the UE's preferences on minimumSchedulingOffset of cross-slot scheduling for power saving.
preferredDRX-InactivityTimer
Indicates the UE's preferred DRX inactivity timer length for power saving. Value in ms (milliSecond). ms0 corresponds to 0, ms1 corresponds to 1 ms, ms2 corresponds to 2 ms, and so on. If the field is absent from the DRX-Preference IE, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference for the DRX inactivity timer. If secondary DRX group is configured, the preferredDRX-InactivityTimer only applies to the default DRX group.
preferredDRX-LongCycle
Indicates the UE's preferred long DRX cycle length for power saving. Value in ms. ms10 corresponds to 10ms, ms20 corresponds to 20 ms, ms32 corresponds to 32 ms, and so on. If preferredDRX-ShortCycle is provided, the value of preferredDRX-LongCycle shall be a multiple of the preferredDRX-ShortCycle value. If the field is absent from the DRX-Preference IE, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference for the long DRX cycle.
preferredDRX-ShortCycle
Indicates the UE's preferred short DRX cycle length for power saving. Value in ms. ms2 corresponds to 2ms, ms3 corresponds to 3 ms, ms4 corresponds to 4 ms, and so on. If the field is absent from the DRX-Preference IE, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference for the short DRX cycle.
preferredDRX-ShortCycleTimer
Indicates the UE's preferred short DRX cycle timer for power saving. Value in multiples of preferredDRX-ShortCycle. A value of 1 corresponds to preferredDRX-ShortCycle, a value of 2 corresponds to 2 * preferredDRX-ShortCycle and so on. If the field is absent from the DRX-Preference IE, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference for the short DRX cycle timer. A preference for the short DRX cycle is indicated when a preference for the short DRX cycle timer is indicated.
preferredK0
Indicates the UE's preferred value of k0 (slot offset between DCI and its scheduled PDSCH - see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.2.1) for cross-slot scheduling for power saving. Value is defined for each subcarrier spacing (numerology) in units of slots. sl1 corresponds to 1 slot, sl2 corresponds to 2 slots, sl4 corresponds to 4 slots, and so on. If a value for a subcarrier spacing is absent, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference on k0 for cross-slot scheduling for that subcarrier spacing. If the field is absent from the MinSchedulingOffsetPreference IE, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference on k0 for cross-slot scheduling.
preferredK2
Indicates the UE's preferred value of k2 (slot offset between DCI and its scheduled PUSCH - see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.1) for cross-slot scheduling for power saving. Value is defined for each subcarrier spacing (numerology) in units of slots. sl1 corresponds to 1 slot, sl2 corresponds to 2 slots, sl4 corresponds to 4 slots, and so on. If a value for a subcarrier spacing is absent, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference on k2 for cross-slot scheduling for that subcarrier spacing. If the field is absent from the MinSchedulingOffsetPreference IE, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference on k2 for cross-slot scheduling.
preferredRRC-State
Indicates the UE's preferred RRC state. The value idle is indicated if the UE prefers to be released from RRC_CONNECTED and transition to RRC_IDLE.

SIB2 field descriptions
absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation
Threshold for consolidation of L1 measurements per RS index. If the field is absent, the UE uses the measurement quantity as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
cellEdgeEvaluation
Indicates the criteria for a UE to detect that it is not at cell edge, in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection (see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.2).
cellReselectionInfoCommon
Cell re-selection information common for intra-frequency, inter-frequency and/ or inter-RAT cell re-selection.
cellReselectionServingFreqInfo
Information common for non-intra-frequency cell re-selection i.e. cell re-selection to inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells.
combineRelaxedMeasCondition
When both lowMobilityEvalutation and cellEdgeEvalutation criteria are present in SIB2, this parameter configures the UE to fulfil both criteria in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection. If the field is absent, the UE is allowed to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection when either or both of the criteria are met. (See TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.0)
deriveSSB-IndexFromCell
This field indicates whether the UE can utilize serving cell timing to derive the index of SS block transmitted by neighbour cell. If this field is set to true, the UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment across cells on the serving frequency as specified in TS 38.133 [14].
frequencyBandList
Indicates the list of frequency bands for which the NR cell reselection parameters apply. The UE behaviour in case the field is absent is described in subclause 5.2.2.4.3.
highPriorityMeasRelax
Indicates whether measurements can be relaxed on high priority frequencies (see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.0). If the field is absent, the UE shall not relax measurements on high priority frequencies beyond "Thigher_priority_search" unless both low mobility and not at cell edge criteria are fulfilled (see TS 38.133 [14], clause 4.2.2.7, and TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.0).
intraFreqCellReselectionInfo
Cell re-selection information common for intra-frequency cells.
lowMobilityEvaluation
Indicates the criteria for a UE to detect low mobility, in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection (see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.1).
nrofSS-BlocksToAverage
Number of SS blocks to average for cell measurement derivation. If the field is absent the UE uses the measurement quantity as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
p-Max
Value in dBm applicable for the intra-frequency neighbouring NR cells. If absent the UE applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-1 [15] in case of an FR1 cell or TS 38.101-2 [39] in case of an FR2 cell. In this release of the specification, if p-Max is present on a carrier frequency in FR2, the UE shall ignore the field and applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-2 [39]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT. The IAB-MT applies output power and emissions requirements, as specified in TS 38.174 [63].
q-Hyst
Parameter "Qhyst" in TS 38.304 [20], Value in dB. Value dB1 corresponds to 1 dB, dB2 corresponds to 2 dB and so on.
q-HystSF
Parameter "Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Qhyst" in TS 38.304 [20]. The sf-Medium and sf-High concern the additional hysteresis to be applied, in Medium and High Mobility state respectively, to Qhyst as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. In dB. Value dB-6 corresponds to -6dB, dB-4 corresponds to -4dB and so on.
q-QualMin
Parameter "Qqualmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for intra-frequency neighbour cells. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of negative infinity for Qqualmin.  
q-RxLevMin
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for intra-frequency neighbour cells.
q-RxLevMinSUL
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for intra-frequency neighbour cells.
rangeToBestCell
Parameter "rangeToBestCell" in TS 38.304 [20]. The network configures only non-negative (in dB) values.
relaxedMeasurement
Configuration to allow relaxation of RRM measurement requirements for cell reselection (see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9).
s-IntraSearchP
Parameter "SIntraSearchP" in TS 38.304 [20].
s-IntraSearchQ
Parameter "SIntraSearchQ" in TS 38.304 [20]. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of 0 dB for SIntraSearchQ.
s-NonIntraSearchP
Parameter "SnonIntraSearchP" in TS 38.304 [20]. If this field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of infinity for SnonIntraSearchP.
s-NonIntraSearchQ
Parameter "SnonIntraSearchQ" in TS 38.304 [20]. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of 0 dB for SnonIntraSearchQ.
s-SearchDeltaP
Parameter "SSearchDeltaP" in TS 38.304 [20]. Value dB3 corresponds to 3 dB, dB6 corresponds to 6 dB and so on.
s-SearchThresholdP
Parameter "SSearchThresholdP" in TS 38.304 [20]. The network configures s-SearchThresholdP to be less than or equal to s-IntraSearchP and s-NonIntraSearchP.
s-SearchThresholdQ
Parameter "SSearchThresholdQ" in TS 38.304 [20]. The network configures s-SearchThresholdQ to be less than or equal to s-IntraSearchQ and s-NonIntraSearchQ.
smtc
Measurement timing configuration for intra-frequency measurement. If this field is absent, the UE assumes that SSB periodicity is 5 ms for the intra-frequnecy cells.
smtc2-LP
Measurement timing configuration for intra-frequency neighbour cells with a Long Periodicity (LP) indicated by periodicity in smtc2-LP. The timing offset and duration are equal to the offset and duration indicated in smtc in intraFreqCellReselectionInfo. The periodicity in smtc2-LP can only be set to a value strictly larger than the periodicity in smtc in intraFreqCellReselectionInfo (e.g. if smtc indicates sf20 the Long Periodicity can only be set to sf40, sf80 or sf160, if smtc indicates sf160, smtc2-LP cannot be configured). The pci-List, if present, includes the physical cell identities of the intra-frequency neighbour cells with Long Periodicity. If smtc2-LP is absent, the UE assumes that there are no intra-frequency neighbour cells with a Long Periodicity.
ssb-PositionQCL-Common
Indicates the QCL relation between SS/PBCH blocks for intra-frequency neighbor cells as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
ssb-ToMeasure
The set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is absent the UE measures on all SS-blocks.
t-ReselectionNR
Parameter "TreselectionNR" in TS 38.304 [20].
t-ReselectionNR-SF
Parameter "Speed dependent ScalingFactor for TreselectionNR" in TS 38.304 [20]. If the field is absent, the UE behaviour is specified in TS 38.304 [20].
threshServingLowP
Parameter "ThreshServing, LowP" in TS 38.304 [20].
threshServingLowQ
Parameter "ThreshServing, LowQ" in TS 38.304 [20].
t-SearchDeltaP
Parameter "TSearchDeltaP" in TS 38.304 [20]. Value in seconds. Value s5 means 5 seconds, value s10 means 10 seconds and so on.

SIB4 field descriptions
absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation
Threshold for consolidation of L1 measurements per RS index. If the field is absent, the UE uses the measurement quantity as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
deriveSSB-IndexFromCell
This field indicates whether the UE may use the timing of any detected cell on that frequency to derive the SSB index of all neighbour cells on that frequency. If this field is set to true, the UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment across cells on the neighbor frequency as specified in TS 38.133 [14].
dl-CarrierFreq
This field indicates center frequency of the SS block of the neighbour cells, where the frequency corresponds to a GSCN value as specified in TS 38.101-1 [15].
frequencyBandList
Indicates the list of frequency bands for which the NR cell reselection parameters apply.
interFreqBlackCellList
List of blacklisted inter-frequency neighbouring cells.
interFreqCAG-CellList
List of inter-frequency neighbouring CAG cells (as defined in TS 38.304 [20] per PLMN.
interFreqCarrierFreqList
List of neighbouring carrier frequencies and frequency specific cell re-selection information. If iinterFreqCarrierFreqList-v1610 is present, it shall contain the same number of entries, listed in the same order as in interFreqCarrierFreqList (without suffix).
interFreqNeighCellList
List of inter-frequency neighbouring cells with specific cell re-selection parameters. If interFreqNeighCellList-v1610 is present, it shall contain the same number of entries, listed in the same order as in interFreqNeighCellList (without suffix).
interFreqWhiteCellList
List of whitelisted inter-frequency neighbouring cells, see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.
nrofSS-BlocksToAverage
Number of SS blocks to average for cell measurement derivation. If the field is absent, the UE uses the measurement quantity as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
p-Max
Value in dBm applicable for the neighbouring NR cells on this carrier frequency. If absent the UE applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-1 [15] in case of an FR1 cell or TS 38.101-2 [39] in case of an FR2 cell. In this release of the specification, if p-Max is present on a carrier frequency in FR2, the UE shall ignore the field and applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-2 [39]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT. The IAB-MT applies output power and emissions requirements, as specified in TS 38.174 [63].
q-OffsetCell
Parameter "Qoffsets,n" in TS 38.304 [20].
q-OffsetFreq
Parameter "Qoffsetfrequency" in TS 38.304 [20].

q-RxLevMinSUL
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20].
smtc
Measurement timing configuration for inter-frequency measurement. If this field is absent, the UE assumes that SSB periodicity is 5 ms in this frequency.
smtc2-LP
Measurement timing configuration for inter-frequency neighbour cells with a Long Periodicity (LP) indicated by periodicity in smtc2-LP. The timing offset and duration are equal to the offset and duration indicated in smtc in InterFreqCarrierFreqInfo. The periodicity in smtc2-LP can only be set to a value strictly larger than the periodicity in smtc in InterFreqCarrierFreqInfo (e.g. if smtc indicates sf20 the Long Periodicity can only be set to sf40, sf80 or sf160, if smtc indicates sf160, smtc2-LP cannot be configured). The pci-List, if present, includes the physical cell identities of the inter-frequency neighbour cells with Long Periodicity. If smtc2-LP is absent, the UE assumes that there are no inter-frequency neighbour cells with a Long Periodicity.

Indicates if and how daylight-saving time (DST) is applied to obtain the local time. The semantics are the same as the semantics of the Daylight Saving Time IE in TS 24.501 [23] and TS 24.008 [38]. The first/leftmost bit of the bit string contains the b2 of octet 3 and the second bit of the bit string contains b1 of octet 3 in the value part of the Daylight Saving Time IE in TS 24.008 [38].
leapSeconds
Number of leap seconds offset between GPS Time and UTC. UTC and GPS time are related i.e. GPS time -leapSeconds = UTC time.
localTimeOffset
Offset between UTC and local time in units of 15 minutes. Actual value = field value * 15 minutes. Local time of the day is calculated as UTC time + localTimeOffset.
timeInfoUTC
Coordinated Universal Time corresponding to the SFN boundary at or immediately after the ending boundary of the SI-window in which SIB9 is transmitted. The field counts the number of UTC seconds in 10 ms units since 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1 January, 1900 (midnight between Sunday, December 31, 1899 and Monday, January 1, 1900). See NOTE 1. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of timeInfoUTC should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1.

NOTE 1:	The UE may use this field together with the leapSeconds field to obtain GPS time as follows: GPS Time (in seconds) = timeInfoUTC (in seconds) -  2,524,953,600 (seconds) + leapSeconds, where 2,524,953,600 is the number of seconds between 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1 January, 1900 and 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 6 January, 1980 (start of GPS time).

Furthermore, the network may configure additional uplink and downlink bandwidth parts for a serving cell.
The uplink and downlink bandwidth part configurations are divided into common and dedicated parameters.

BWP field descriptions
cyclicPrefix
Indicates whether to use the extended cyclic prefix for this bandwidth part. If not set, the UE uses the normal cyclic prefix. Normal CP is supported for all subcarrier spacings and slot formats. Extended CP is supported only for 60 kHz subcarrier spacing. (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 4.2). Except for SUL, the network ensures the same cyclic prefix length is used in active DL BWP and active UL BWP within a serving cell.
locationAndBandwidth
Frequency domain location and bandwidth of this bandwidth part. The value of the field shall be interpreted as resource indicator value (RIV) as defined TS 38.214 [19] with assumptions as described in TS 38.213 [13], clause 12, i.e. setting =275. The first PRB is a PRB determined by subcarrierSpacing of this BWP and offsetToCarrier (configured in SCS-SpecificCarrier contained within FrequencyInfoDL / FrequencyInfoUL / FrequencyInfoUL-SIB / FrequencyInfoDL-SIB within ServingCellConfigCommon / ServingCellConfigCommonSIB) corresponding to this subcarrier spacing. In case of TDD, a BWP-pair (UL BWP and DL BWP with the same bwp-Id) must have the same center frequency (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 12)
subcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing to be used in this BWP for all channels and reference signals unless explicitly configured elsewhere. Corresponds to subcarrier spacing according to TS 38.211 [16], table 4.2-1. The value kHz15 corresponds to µ=0, value kHz30 corresponds to µ=1, and so on. Only the values 15 kHz, 30 kHz, or 60 kHz (FR1), and 60 kHz or 120 kHz (FR2) are applicable. For the initial DL BWP and operation in licensed spectrum this field has the same value as the field subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB of the same serving cell. Except for SUL, the network ensures the same subcarrier spacing is used in active DL BWP and active UL BWP within a serving cell. For the initial DL BWP and operation with shared spectrum channel access, the value of this field corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP.

BWP-UplinkCommon field descriptions
msgA-ConfigCommon
Configuration of the cell specific PRACH and PUSCH resource parameters for transmission of MsgA in 2-step random access type procedure. The NW can configure msgA-ConfigCommon only for UL BWPs if the linked DL BWPs (same bwp-Id as UL-BWP) are the initial DL BWPs or DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial BL BWP
pucch-ConfigCommon
Cell specific parameters for the PUCCH of this BWP. 
pusch-ConfigCommon
Cell specific parameters for the PUSCH of this BWP.
rach-ConfigCommon
Configuration of cell specific random access parameters which the UE uses for contention based and contention free random access as well as for contention based beam failure recovery in this BWP. The NW configures SSB-based RA (and hence RACH-ConfigCommon) only for UL BWPs if the linked DL BWPs (same bwp-Id as UL-BWP) are the initial DL BWPs or DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP. The network configures rach-ConfigCommon, whenever it configures contention free random access (for reconfiguration with sync or for beam failure recovery). 
rach-ConfigCommonIAB
Configuration of cell specific random access parameters for the IAB-MT. The IAB specific IAB RACH configuration is used by IAB-MT, if configured.
useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH
If the field is present, the UE uses uplink frequency domain resource allocation Type 2 for cell-specific PUSCH, e.g., PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant (see 38.213 clause 8.3 and 38.214 clause 6.1.2.2) and uses interlaced PUCCH Format 0 and 1 for cell-specific PUCCH (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1).

BWP-UplinkDedicated field descriptions
beamFailureRecoveryConfig
Configuration of beam failure recovery. If supplementaryUplink is present, the field is present only in one of the uplink carriers, either UL or SUL.
configuredGrantConfig
A Configured-Grant of type1 or type2. It may be configured for UL or SUL but in case of type1 not for both at a time. Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure configuredGrantConfig when there is an active configured uplink grant Type 2 (see TS 38.321 [3]). However, the NW may release the configuredGrantConfig at any time. Network can only configure configured grant in one BWP using either this field or configuredGrantConfigToAddModList.
configuredGrantConfigToAddModList
Indicates a list of one or more configured grant configurations to be added or modified for one BWP. Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure a Type 2 configured grant configuration when it is active (see TS 38.321 [3]).
configuredGrantConfigToReleaseList
Indicates a list of one or more UL Configured Grant configurations to be released. The NW may release a configured grant configuration at any time.
configuredGrantConfigType2DeactivationStateList
Indicates a list of the deactivation states in which each state can be mapped to a single or multiple Configured Grant type 2 configurations to be deactivated when the corresponding deactivation DCI is received, see clause 7.3.1 in TS 38.212 [17] and clause 10.2 in TS 38.213 [13].
cp-ExtensionC2, cp-ExtensionC3
Configures the cyclic prefix (CP) extension (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.1). For 15 and 30 kHz SCS, {1..28} are valid for both cp-ExtensionC2 and cp-ExtensionC3. For 30 kHz SCS, {1..28} are valid for cp-ExtensionC2 and {2..28} are valid for cp-ExtensionC3. For 60 kHz SCS, {2..28} are valid for cp-ExtensionC2 and {3..28} are valid for cp-ExtensionC3.
lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig
Configures parameters used for detection of consistent uplink LBT failures for operation with shared spectrum channel access, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
pucch-Config
PUCCH configuration for one BWP of the normal UL or SUL of a serving cell. If the UE is configured with SUL, the network configures PUCCH only on the BWPs of one of the uplinks (normal UL or SUL). The network configures PUCCH-Config at least on non-initial BWP(s) for SpCell and PUCCH SCell. If supported by the UE, the network may configure at most one additional SCell of a cell group with PUCCH-Config (i.e. PUCCH SCell).
In (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC, the NW configures at most one serving cell per frequency range with PUCCH. In (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC, if two PUCCH groups are configured, the serving cells of the NR PUCCH group in FR2 use the same numerology. For NR-DC, the maximum number of PUCCH groups in each cell group is one, and only the same numerology is supported for the cell group with carriers only in FR2.
The NW may configure PUCCH for a BWP when setting up the BWP. The network may also add/remove the pucch-Config in an RRCReconfiguration with reconfigurationWithSync (for SpCell or PUCCH SCell) or with SCell release and add (for PUCCH SCell) to move the PUCCH between the UL and SUL carrier of one serving cell. In other cases, only modifications of a previously configured pucch-Config are allowed.
If one (S)UL BWP of a serving cell is configured with PUCCH, all other (S)UL BWPs must be configured with PUCCH, too.
pucch-ConfigurationList
PUCCH configurations for two simultaneously constructed HARQ-ACK codebooks (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1). Different PUCCH Resource IDs are configured in different PUCCH-Config within the pucch-ConfigurationList if configured.

pusch-Config
PUSCH configuration for one BWP of the normal UL or SUL of a serving cell. If the UE is configured with SUL and if it has a PUSCH-Config for both UL and SUL, an UL/SUL indicator field in DCI indicates which of the two to use. See TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1.
sl-PUCCH-Config
Indicates the UE specific PUCCH configurations used for the HARQ-ACK feedback reporting for NR sidelink communication.
srs-Config
Uplink sounding reference signal configuration.
useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH
If the field is present, the UE uses uplink frequency domain resource allocation Type 2 for PUSCH (see 38.213 clause 8.3 and 38.214 clause 6.1.2.2) and uses interlaced PUCCH Format 0, 1, 2, and 3 for PUCCH (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1).

Conditional Presence
Explanation
SpCellOnly
The field is optionally present, Need M, in the BWP-UplinkDedicated of an SpCell. It is absent otherwise. 

NOTE 1:	In case of RRCReconfiguration with reconfigurationWithSync, the UE performs a MAC reset, which involves releasing the PUCCH-CSI/SRS/SR configuration in accordance with clause 5.3.12 and TS 38.321 [6], clauses 5.12 and 5.2. Hence, for these parts of the dedicated radio resource configuration, delta signalling is not supported in the message when reconfigurationWithSync is included.

cellReservedForOtherUse
Indicates whether the cell is reserved, as defined in 38.304 [20]. The field is applicable to all PLMNs. This field is ignored by IAB-MT for cell barring determination, but still considered by NPN capable IAB-MT for determination of an NPN-only cell.
npn-IdentityInfoList
The npn-IdentityInfoList is used to configure a set of NPN-IdentityInfo elements. Each of those elements contains a list of one or more NPN Identities and additional information associated with those NPNs. The total number of PLMNs (identified by a PLMN identity in plmn -IdentityList), PNI-NPNs (identified by a PLMN identity and a CAG-ID), and SNPNs (identified by a PLMN identity and a NID) together in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList and NPN-IdentityInfoList does not exceed 12, except for the NPN-only cells. A PNI-NPN and SNPN can be included only once, and in only one entry of the NPN-IdentityInfoList. In case of NPN-only cells the PLMN-IdentityList contains a single element that does not count to the limit of 12. The NPN index is defined as B+c1+c2+…+c(n-1)+d1+d2+…+d(m-1)+e(i) for the NPN identity included in the n-th entry of NPN-IdentityInfoList and in the m-th entry of npn-Identitylist within that NPN-IdentityInfoList entry, and the i-th entry of its corresponding NPN-Identity, where
- B is the index used for the last PLMN in the PLMN-IdentittyInfoList; in NPN-only cells B is considered 0;
- c(j) is the number of NPN index values used in the j-th NPN-IdentityInfoList entry;
- d(k) is the number of NPN index values used in the k-th npn-IdentityList entry within the n-th NPN-IdentityInfoList entry;
- e(i) is
    - i if the n-th entry of NPN-IdentityInfoList entry is for SNPN(s);
    - 1 if the n-th entry of NPN-IdentityInfoList entry is for PNI-NPN(s).

rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold
BLER threshold pair index for IS/OOS indication generation, see TS 38.133 [14], table 8.1.1-1. n1 corresponds to the value 1. When the field is absent, the UE applies the value 0. Whenever this is reconfigured, UE resets N310 and N311, and stops T310, if running. Network does not include this field.
sCellState
Indicates whether the SCell shall be considered to be in activated state upon SCell configuration.
sCellToAddModList
List of secondary serving cells (SCells) to be added or modified.
sCellToReleaseList
List of secondary serving cells (SCells) to be released.

spCellConfig
Parameters for the SpCell of this cell group (PCell of MCG or PSCell of SCG). 
uplinkTxSwitchingOption
Indicates which option is configured for dynamic UL Tx switching for inter-band UL CA or (NG)EN-DC. The field is set to switchedUL if network configures option 1 as specified in TS 38.214 [19], or dualUL if network configures option 2 as specified in TS 38.214 [19]. Network always configures UE with a value for this field in inter-band UL CA case and (NG)EN-DC case where UE supports dynamic UL Tx switching.
uplinkTxSwitchingPowerBoosting
Indicates whether the UE is allowed to enable 3dB boosting on the maximum output power for transmission on carrier2 under the operation state in which 2-port transmission can be supported on carrier2 for inter-band UL CA case with dynamic UL Tx switching as defined in TS 38.101-1 [15]. Network can only configure this field for dynamic UL Tx switching in inter-band UL CA case with power Class 3 as defined in TS 38.101-1 [15].

DAPS-UplinkPowerConfig field descriptions

ReconfigurationWithSync field descriptions
rach-ConfigDedicated
Random access configuration to be used for the reconfiguration with sync (e.g. handover). The UE performs the RA according to these parameters in the firstActiveUplinkBWP (see UplinkConfig).
smtc
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR PSCell change and NR PCell change. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssb-periodicityServingCell in spCellConfigCommon.
For case of NR PCell change, the smtc is based on the timing reference of (source) PCell. For case of NR PSCell change, it is based on the timing reference of source PSCell.
If both this field and targetCellSMTC-SCG are absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.

SCellConfig field descriptions
smtc
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR SCell addition. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssb-periodicityServingCell in sCellConfigCommon. The smtc is based on the timing of the SpCell of associated cell group. In case of inter-RAT handover to NR, the timing reference is the NR PCell. In case of intra-NR PCell change (standalone NR) or NR PSCell change (EN-DC), the timing reference is the target SpCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.

SpCellConfig field descriptions
reconfigurationWithSync
Parameters for the synchronous reconfiguration to the target SpCell.
rlf-TimersAndConstants
Timers and constants for detecting and triggering cell-level radio link failure. For the SCG, rlf-TimersAndConstants can only be set to setup and is always included at SCG addition.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
BWP-Reconfig
The field is optionally present, Need N, if the BWPs are reconfigured or if serving cells are added or removed. Otherwise it is absent. 
DRX-Config2
The field is optionally present, Need N, if drx-ConfigSecondaryGroup is configured. It is absent otherwise.
ReconfWithSync
The field is mandatory present in the RRCReconfiguration message:
-	in each configured CellGroupConfig for which the SpCell changes,
-	in the masterCellGroup:
-	at change of AS security key derived from KgNB,
-	in an RRCReconfiguration message contained in a DLInformationTransferMRDC message,
-	in the secondaryCellGroup at:
-	PSCell addition,
-	SCG resume with NR-DC or (NG)EN-DC,
-	update of required SI for PSCell,
-	change of AS security key derived from S-KgNB in NR-DC while the UE is configured with at least one radio bearer with keyToUse set to secondary and that is not released by this RRCReconfiguration message,
-	MN handover in (NG)EN-DC.
Otherwise, it is optionally present, need M. The field is absent in the masterCellGroup in RRCResume and RRCSetup messages and is absent in the masterCellGroup in RRCReconfiguration messages if source configuration is not released during DAPS handover.
SCellAdd
The field is mandatory present upon SCell addition; otherwise it is absent, Need M.
SCellAddMod
The field is mandatory present upon SCell addition; otherwise it is optionally present, need M.
SCellAddSync

SCG
The field is mandatory present in an SpCellConfig for the PSCell. It is absent otherwise. 

NOTE:	In case of change of AS security key derived from S-KgNB/S-KeNB, if reconfigurationWithSync is not included in the masterCellGroup, the network releases all existing MCG RLC bearers associated with a radio bearer with keyToUse set to secondary. In case of change of AS security key derived from KgNB/KeNB, if reconfigurationWithSync is not included in the secondaryCellGroup, the network releases all existing SCG RLC bearers associated with a radio bearer with keyToUse set to primary.

ControlResourceSet field descriptions
cce-REG-MappingType
Mapping of Control Channel Elements (CCE) to Resource Element Groups (REG) (see TS 38.211 [16], clauses 7.3.2.2 and 7.4.1.3.2).
controlResourceSetId
Identifies the instance of the ControlResourceSet IE. Value 0 identifies the common CORESET configured in MIB and in ServingCellConfigCommon (controlResourceSetZero) and is hence not used here in the ControlResourceSet IE. Other values identify CORESETs configured by dedicated signalling or in SIB1. The controlResourceSetId is unique among the BWPs of a serving cell.
If the field controlResourceSetId-v1610 is present, the UE shall ignore the controlResourceSetId field (without suffix).
coresetPoolIndex
The index of the CORESET pool for this CORESET as specified in TS 38.213 [13] (clauses 9 and 10) and TS 38.214 [19] (clauses 5.1 and 6.1). If the field is absent, the UE applies the value 0.
duration
Contiguous time duration of the CORESET in number of symbols (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
frequencyDomainResources
Frequency domain resources for the CORESET. Each bit corresponds a group of 6 RBs, with grouping starting from the first RB group in the BWP. When at least one search space is configured with freqMonitorLocation-r16, only the first  bits are valid (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). The first (left-most / most significant) bit corresponds to the first RB group in the BWP, and so on. A bit that is set to 1 indicates that this RB group belongs to the frequency domain resource of this CORESET. Bits corresponding to a group of RBs not fully contained in the bandwidth part within which the CORESET is configured are set to zero (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
interleaverSize
Interleaver-size (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID
PDCCH DMRS scrambling initialization (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.3.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value of the physCellId configured for this serving cell.
precoderGranularity
Precoder granularity in frequency domain (see TS 38.211 [16], clauses 7.3.2.2 and 7.4.1.3.2).
rb-Offset
Indicates the RB level offset in units of RB from the first RB of the first 6RB group to the first RB of BWP (see 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). When the field is absent, the UE applies the value 0.
reg-BundleSize
Resource Element Groups (REGs) can be bundled to create REG bundles. This parameter defines the size of such bundles (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
shiftIndex
When the field is absent the UE applies the value of the physCellIdconfigured for this serving cell (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
tci-PresentInDCI
This field indicates if TCI field is present or absent in DCI format 1_1. When the field is absent the UE considers the TCI to be absent/disabled. In case of cross carrier scheduling, the network sets this field to enabled for the ControlResourceSet used for cross carrier scheduling in DCI format 1_1 in the scheduling cell if enableDefaultBeamForCCS is not configured (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.5).
tci-PresentDCI-1-2
Configures the number of bits for "Transmission configuration indicator" in DCI format 1_2. When the field is absent the UE applies the value of 0 bit for the "Transmission configuration indicator" in DCI format 1_2 (see TS 38.212, clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.214, clause 5.1.5). In case of cross carrier scheduling, the network configures this field for the ControlResourceSet used for cross carrier scheduling in DCI format 1_2 in the scheduling cell if enableDefaultBeamForCCS is not configured (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.5).
tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList
A subset of the TCI states defined in pdsch-Config included in the BWP-DownlinkDedicated corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the ControlResourceSet belong to. They are used for providing QCL relationships between the DL RS(s) in one RS Set (TCI-State) and the PDCCH DMRS ports (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 6.). The network configures at most maxNrofTCI-StatesPDCCH entries.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
NotSIB1-initialBWP
The field is absent in SIB1 and in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon of the initial BWP in ServingCellConfigCommon, if SIB1 is broadcasted. Otherwise, it is optionally present, Need N.

–	ControlResourceSetId
The ControlResourceSetId IE concerns a short identity, used to identify a control resource set within a serving cell. The ControlResourceSetId = 0 identifies the ControlResourceSet#0 configured via PBCH (MIB) and in controlResourceSetZero (ServingCellConfigCommon). The ID space is used across the BWPs of a Serving Cell.

CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig field descriptions
carrierIndicatorSizeDCI-0-2, carrierIndicatorSizeDCI-1-2
Configures the number of bits for the field of carrier indicator in PDCCH DCI format 0_2/1_2. The field carrierIndicatorSizeDCI-0-2 refers to DCI format 0_2 and the field carrierIndicatorSizeDCI-1-2 refers to DCI format 1_2, respectively (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
cif-Presence
The field is used to indicate whether carrier indicator field is present (value true) or not (value false) in PDCCH DCI formats, see TS 38.213 [13]. If cif-Presence is set to true, the CIF value indicating a grant or assignment for this cell is 0.
cif-InSchedulingCell
The field indicates the CIF value used in the scheduling cell to indicate a grant or assignment applicable for this cell, see TS 38.213 [13].
enableDefaultBeamForCCS
This field indicates whether default beam selection for cross-carrier scheduled PDSCH is enabled, see TS 38.214 [19]. If not present, the default beam selection behaviour is not applied, i.e. Rel-15 behaviour is applied.
other
Parameters for cross-carrier scheduling, i.e., a serving cell is scheduled by a PDCCH on another (scheduling) cell. The network configures this field only for SCells.
own
Parameters for self-scheduling, i.e., a serving cell is scheduled by its own PDCCH.
schedulingCellId
Indicates which cell signals the downlink allocations and uplink grants, if applicable, for the concerned SCell. In case the UE is configured with DC, the scheduling cell is part of the same cell group (i.e. MCG or SCG) as the scheduled cell. In case the UE is configured with two PUCCH groups, the scheduling cell and the scheduled cell are within the same PUCCH group. If drx-ConfigSecondaryGroup is configured in the MAC-CellGroupConfig associated with this serving cell, the scheduling cell and the scheduled cell belong to the same Frequency Range. In addition, the serving cell with an aperiodic CSI trigger and the PUSCH resource scheduled for the report are on the same carrier and serving cell, but the cell for which CSI is reported may belong to the same or a different Frequency Range. The network should not trigger a CSI request for a serving cell in the other Frequency Range when that serving cell is outside Active Time.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
CIF-PRESENCE
The field is mandatory present if the cif-Presence is set to true. The field is absent otherwise.

–	CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList
The CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList IE is used to configure the UE with a list of aperiodic trigger states. Each codepoint of the DCI field "CSI request" is associated with one trigger state (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 6.1.3.13). Upon reception of the value associated with a trigger state, the UE will perform measurement of CSI-RS, CSI-IM and/or SSB (reference signals) and aperiodic reporting on L1 according to all entries in the associatedReportConfigInfoList for that trigger state.

Selection of the DMRS type to be used for UL (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3) If the field is absent, the UE uses DMRS type 1.
dmrs-Uplink
This field indicates whether low PAPR DMRS is used, as specified in TS38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.1.
dmrs-UplinkTransformPrecoding
This field indicates whether low PAPR DMRS is used for PUSCH with pi/2 BPSK modulation, as specified in TS38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.2. The network configures this field only if tp-pi2BPSK is configured in PUSCH-Config.
maxLength
The maximum number of OFDM symbols for UL front loaded DMRS. len1 corresponds to value 1. len2 corresponds to value 2. If the field is absent, the UE applies value len1. If set to len2, the UE determines the actual number of DM-RS symbols by the associated DCI. (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3).
nPUSCH-Identity
Parameter: N_ID^(PUSCH) for DFT-s-OFDM DMRS. If the value is absent or released, the UE uses the value Physical cell ID (physCellId). See TS 38.211 [16].
phaseTrackingRS
Configures uplink PTRS (see TS 38.211 [16]).
pi2BPSK-ScramblingID0, pi2BPSK-ScramblingID1
UL DMRS scrambling initialization for pi/2 BPSK DMRS for PUSCH (see TS 38.211 [16], Clause 6.4.1.1.2). When the field is absent the UE applies the value Physical cell ID (physCellId) of the serving cell.

UL DMRS scrambling initialization for CP-OFDM (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value Physical cell ID (physCellId).
scramblingID1
UL DMRS scrambling initialization for CP-OFDM. (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value Physical cell ID (physCellId).
sequenceGroupHopping
For DMRS transmission with transform precoder the NW may configure group hopping by the cell-specific parameter groupHoppingEnabledTransformPrecoding in PUSCH-ConfigCommon. In this case, the NW may include this UE specific field to disable group hopping for PUSCH transmission except for Msg3, i.e., to override the configuration in PUSCH-ConfigCommon (see TS 38.211 [16]). If the field is absent, the UE uses the same hopping mode as for Msg3.
sequenceHopping
Determines if sequence hopping is enabled for DMRS transmission with transform precoder for PUSCH transmission other than Msg3 (sequence hopping is always disabled for Msg3). If the field is absent, the UE uses the same hopping mode as for msg3. The network does not configure simultaneous group hopping and sequence hopping. See TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.2.

defaultPagingCycle
Default paging cycle, used to derive 'T' in TS 38.304 [20]. Value rf32 corresponds to 32 radio frames, value rf64 corresponds to 64 radio frames and so on.
firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO
Points out the first PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging of each PO of the PF, see TS 38.304 [20].
nAndPagingFrameOffset
Used to derive the number of total paging frames in T (corresponding to parameter N in TS 38.304 [20]) and paging frame offset (corresponding to parameter PF_offset in TS 38.304 [20]). A value of oneSixteenthT corresponds to T / 16, a value of oneEighthT corresponds to T / 8, and so on.
If pagingSearchSpace is set to zero and if SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern is 2 or 3 (as specified in TS 38.213 [13]):
-	for ssb-periodicityServingCell of 5 or 10 ms, N can be set to one of {oneT, halfT, quarterT, oneEighthT, oneSixteenthT}
-	for ssb-periodicityServingCell of 20 ms, N can be set to one of {halfT, quarterT, oneEighthT, oneSixteenthT}
-	for ssb-periodicityServingCell of 40 ms, N can be set to one of {quarterT, oneEighthT, oneSixteenthT}
-	for ssb-periodicityServingCell of 80 ms, N can be set to one of {oneEighthT, oneSixteenthT}
-	for ssb-periodicityServingCell of 160 ms, N can be set to oneSixteenthT
If pagingSearchSpace is set to zero and if SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern is 1 (as specified in TS 38.213 [13]), N can be set to one of {halfT, quarterT, oneEighthT, oneSixteenthT}
If pagingSearchSpace is not set to zero, N can be configured to one of {oneT, halfT, quarterT, oneEighthT, oneSixteenthT}

FrequencyInfoDL field descriptions
absoluteFrequencyPointA
Absolute frequency position of the reference resource block (Common RB 0). Its lowest subcarrier is also known as Point A (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 4.4.4.2). Note that the lower edge of the actual carrier is not defined by this field but rather in the scs-SpecificCarrierList.
absoluteFrequencySSB
Frequency of the SSB to be used for this serving cell. SSB related parameters (e.g. SSB index) provided for a serving cell refer to this SSB frequency unless mentioned otherwise. The cell-defining SSB of the PCell is always on the sync raster. Frequencies are considered to be on the sync raster if they are also identifiable with a GSCN value (see TS 38.101-1 [15]). If the field is absent, the SSB related parameters should be absent, e.g. ssb-PositionsInBurst, ssb-periodicityServingCell and subcarrierSpacing in ServingCellConfigCommon IE. If the field is absent, the UE obtains timing reference from the SpCell. This is only supported in case the SCell is in the same frequency band as the SpCell.
frequencyBandList
List containing only one frequency band to which this carrier(s) belongs. Multiple values are not supported.
scs-SpecificCarrierList
A set of carriers for different subcarrier spacings (numerologies). Defined in relation to Point A. The network configures a scs-SpecificCarrier at least for each numerology (SCS) that is used e.g. in a BWP (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3).

carrierFreq
The EARFCN value of the carrier received from upper layers for which the UE needs to perform the inter-RAT RSTD measurements.
measPRS-Offset
Indicates the requested gap offset for performing RSTD measurements towards E-UTRA. It is the smallest subframe offset from the beginning of subframe 0 of SFN=0 of the serving cell of the requested gap for measuring PRS positioning occasions in the carrier frequency carrierFreq for which the UE needs to perform the inter-RAT RSTD measurements. The PRS positioning occasion information is received from upper layers. The value of measPRS-Offset is obtained by mapping the starting subframe of the PRS positioning occasion in the measured cell onto the corresponding subframe in the serving cell and is calculated as the serving cell's number of subframes from SFN=0 mod 40.
The UE shall take into account any additional time required by the UE to start PRS measurements on the other carrier when it does this mapping for determining the measPRS-Offset.

refServCellIndex
The index of the reference serving cell that the refBWP belongs to. If this field is absent, the reference serving cell is PCell.
srs-SCS
Subcarrier spacing for SRS. Only the values 15, 30 kHz or 60 kHz (FR1), and 60 or 120 kHz (FR2) are applicable.

RSSI-ResourceConfigCLI field descriptions
nrofPRBs
Allowed size of the measurement BW. Only multiples of 4 are allowed. The smallest configurable number is the minimum of 4 and the width of the active DL BWP. If the configured value is larger than the width of the active DL BWP, the UE shall assume that the actual CLI-RSSI resource bandwidth is within the active DL BWP.
nrofSymbols
Within a slot that is configured for CLI-RSSI measurement (see slotConfiguration), the UE measures the RSSI from startPosition to startPosition + nrofSymbols - 1. The configured CLI-RSSI resource does not exceed the slot boundary of the reference SCS. If the SCS of configured DL BWP(s) is larger than the reference SCS, network configures startPosition and nrofSymbols such that the configured CLI-RSSI resource not to exceed the slot boundary corresponding to the configured BWP SCS. If the reference SCS is larger than SCS of configured DL BWP(s), network ensures startPosition and nrofSymbols are integer multiple of reference SCS divided by configured BWP SCS.
refServCellIndex
The index of the reference serving cell. Frequency reference point of the RSSI resource is subcarrier 0 of CRB0 of the reference serving cell. If this field is absent, the reference serving cell is PCell.
rssi-PeriodicityAndOffset
Periodicity and slot offset for this CLI-RSSI resource. All values are in "number of slots". Value sl1 corresponds to a periodicity of 1 slot, value sl2 corresponds to a periodicity of 2 slots, and so on. For each periodicity the corresponding offset is given in number of slots.
rssi-SCS
Reference subcarrier spacing for CLI-RSSI measurement. Only the values 15, 30 kHz or 60 kHz (FR1), and 60 or 120 kHz (FR2) are applicable. UE performs CLI-RSSI measurement with the SCS of the active bandwidth part within the configured CLI-RSSI resource in the active BWP regardless of the reference SCS of the measurement resource.
startPosition
OFDM symbol location of the CLI-RSSI resource within a slot.
startPRB
Starting PRB index of the measurement bandwidth. For the case where the reference subcarrier spacing is smaller than subcarrier spacing of active DL BWP(s), network configures startPRB and nrofPRBs are as a multiple of active BW SCS divided by reference SCS.

SSB-ConfigMobility field descriptions
deriveSSB-IndexFromCell
If this field is set to true, UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment across cells on the same frequency carrier as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. Hence, if the UE is configured with a serving cell for which (absoluteFrequencySSB, subcarrierSpacing) in ServingCellConfigCommon is equal to (ssbFrequency, ssbSubcarrierSpacing) in this MeasObjectNR, this field indicates whether the UE can utilize the timing of this serving cell to derive the index of SS block transmitted by neighbour cell. Otherwise, this field indicates whether the UE may use the timing of any detected cell on that target frequency to derive the SSB index of all neighbour cells on that frequency.
ssb-ToMeasure
The set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 0, the second bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 1, and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is not to be measured while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is to be measured (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is not configured the UE measures on all SS blocks. Regardless of the value of this field, SS/PBCH blocks outside of the applicable smtc are not to be measured. See TS 38.215 [9] clause 5.1.1.

The UE shall consider entries in controlResourceSetToAddModList and in controlResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt as a single list, i.e. an entry created using controlResourceSetToAddModList can be modifed using controlResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt (or deleted using controlResourceSetToReleaseListSizeExt) and vice-versa. In case network reconfigures control resource set with the same ControlResourceSetId as used for commonControlResourceSet configured via PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the configuration from PDCCH-Config always takes precedence and should not be updated by the UE based on servingCellConfigCommon.
controlResourceSetToReleaseList, controlResourceSetToReleaseListSizeExt
List of UE specifically configured Control Resource Sets (CORESETs) to be released by the UE. This field only applies to CORESETs configured by controlResourceSetToAddModList or controlResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt and does not release the field commonControlResourceSet configured by PDCCH-ConfigCommon.
downlinkPreemption
Configuration of downlink preemption indications to be monitored in this cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.2).
monitoringCapabilityConfig
Configures either Rel-15 PDCCH monitoring capability or Rel-16 PDCCH monitoring capability for PDCCH monitoring on a serving cell. Value r15monitoringcapablity enables the Rel-15 monitoring capability, and value r16monitoringcapablity enables the Rel-16 PDCCH monitoring capability (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
searchSpacesToAddModList, searchSpacesToAddModListExt
List of UE specifically configured Search Spaces. The network configures at most 10 Search Spaces per BWP per cell (including UE-specific and common Search Spaces). If the network includes searchSpaceToAddModListExt, it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in searchSpacesToAddModList.
tpc-PUCCH
Enable and configure reception of group TPC commands for PUCCH.
tpc-PUSCH
Enable and configure reception of group TPC commands for PUSCH.
tpc-SRS
Enable and configure reception of group TPC commands for SRS.
uplinkCancellation
Configuration of uplink cancellation indications to be monitored in this cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.2A).

SearchSpaceSwitchConfig field descriptions
cellGroupsForSwitchList
The list of serving cells which are bundled for the search space group switching purpose (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.4). A serving cell can belong to only one CellGroupForSwitch. The network configures the same list for all BWPs of serving cells in the same CellGroupForSwitch.
searchSpaceSwitchDelay
Indicates the value to be applied by a UE for Search Space Set Group switching; corresponds to the P value in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.4. The network configures the same value for all BWPs of serving cells in the same CellGroupForSwitch.

PDCCH-ConfigCommon field descriptions
commonControlResourceSet
An additional common control resource set which may be configured and used for any common or UE-specific search space. If the network configures this field, it uses a ControlResourceSetId other than 0 for this ControlResourceSet. The network configures the commonControlResourceSet in SIB1 so that it is contained in the bandwidth of CORESET#0.
commonSearchSpaceList, commonSearchSpaceListExt
A list of additional common search spaces. If the network configures this field, it uses the SearchSpaceIds other than 0. If the field is included, it replaces any previous list, i.e. all the entries of the list are replaced and each of the SearchSpace entries is considered to be newly created and the conditions and Need codes for setup of the entry apply. If the network includes commonSearchSpaceListExt, it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in commonSearchSpaceList.
controlResourceSetZero
Parameters of the common CORESET#0 which can be used in any common or UE-specific search spaces. The values are interpreted like the corresponding bits in MIB pdcch-ConfigSIB1. Even though this field is only configured in the initial BWP (BWP#0) controlResourceSetZero can be used in search spaces configured in other DL BWP(s) than the initial DL BWP if the conditions defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10 are satisfied.
firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO
Indicates the first PDCCH monitoring occasion of each PO of the PF on this BWP, see TS 38.304 [20].
pagingSearchSpace
ID of the Search space for paging (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). If the field is absent, the UE does not receive paging in this BWP (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10).
ra-SearchSpace
ID of the Search space for random access procedure (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). If the field is absent, the UE does not receive RAR in this BWP. This field is mandatory present in the DL BWP(s) if the conditions described in TS 38.321 [3], subclause 5.15 are met.
searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation
ID of the Search space for other system information, i.e., SIB2 and beyond (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1) If the field is absent, the UE does not receive other system information in this BWP.
searchSpaceSIB1
ID of the search space for SIB1 message. In the initial DL BWP of the UE′s PCell, the network sets this field to 0. If the field is absent, the UE does not receive SIB1 in this BWP. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10)
searchSpaceZero
Parameters of the common SearchSpace#0. The values are interpreted like the corresponding bits in MIB pdcch-ConfigSIB1. Even though this field is only configured in the initial BWP (BWP#0), searchSpaceZero can be used in search spaces configured in other DL BWP(s) than the initial DL BWP if the conditions described in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10, are satisfied.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
InitialBWP-Only
If SIB1 is broadcast the field is mandatory present in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon of the initial BWP (BWP#0) in ServingCellConfigCommon; it is absent in other BWPs and when sent in system information. If SIB1 is not broadcast and there is an SSB associated to the cell, the field is optionally present, Need M, in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon of the initial BWP (BWP#0) in ServingCellConfigCommon (still with the same setting for all UEs). In other cases, the field is absent.
OtherBWP
This field is optionally present, Need R, if this BWP is not the initial DL BWP and pagingSearchSpace is configured in this BWP. Otherwise this field is absent.

PDCP-Config field descriptions
cipheringDisabled
If included, ciphering is disabled for this DRB regardless of which ciphering algorithm is configured for the SRB/DRBs. The field may only be included if the UE is connected to 5GC. Otherwise the field is absent. The network configures all DRBs with the same PDU-session ID with same value for this field. The value for this field cannot be changed after the DRB is set up.
discardTimer
Value in ms of discardTimer specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms10 corresponds to 10 ms, value ms20 corresponds to 20 ms and so on. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
discardTimerExt
Value in ms of discardTimer specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms0dot5 corresponds to 0.5 ms, value ms1 corresponds to 1ms and so on. If this field is present, the field discardTimer is ignored and discardTimerExt is used instead.
drb-ContinueROHC
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the ROHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. This field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated. The network does not include the field if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
duplicationState
This field indicates the uplink PDCP duplication state for the associated RLC entities at the time of receiving this IE. If set to true, the PDCP duplication state is activated for the associated RLC entity. The index for the indication is determined by ascending order of logical channel ID of all RLC entities other than the primary RLC entity indicated by primaryPath in the order of MCG and SCG, as in clause 6.1.3.32 of TS 38.321 [3]. If the number of associated RLC entities other than the primary RLC entity is two, UE ignores the value in the largest index of this field. If the field is absent, the PDCP duplication states are deactivated for all associated RLC entities. 
ethernetHeaderCompression
This fields configures Ethernet Header Compresssion. This field can only be configured for a bi-directional DRB. The network reconfigures ethernetHeaderCompression only upon reconfiguration involving PDCP re-establishment and with neither drb-ContinueEHC-DL nor drb-ContinueEHC-UL configured.
headerCompression
If rohc is configured, the UE shall apply the configured ROHC profile(s) in both uplink and downlink. If uplinkOnlyROHC is configured, the UE shall apply the configured ROHC profile(s) in uplink (there is no header compression in downlink). ROHC can be configured for any bearer type. ROHC and EHC can be both configured simultaneously for a DRB. The network reconfigures headerCompression only upon reconfiguration involving PDCP re-establishment, and without any drb-ContinueROHC. Network configures headerCompression to notUsed when outOfOrderDelivery is configured.
integrityProtection
Indicates whether or not integrity protection is configured for this radio bearer. The network configures all DRBs with the same PDU-session ID with same value for this field. The value for this field cannot be changed after the DRB is set up.
maxCID
Indicates the value of the MAX_CID parameter as specified in TS 38.323 [5].
The total value of MAX_CIDs across all bearers for the UE should be less than or equal to the value of maxNumberROHC-ContextSessions parameter as indicated by the UE.
moreThanOneRLC
This field configures UL data transmission when more than one RLC entity is associated with the PDCP entity. This field is not present if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
moreThanTwoRLC-DRB
This field configures UL data transmission when more than two RLC entities are associated with the PDCP entity for DRBs.
outOfOrderDelivery
Indicates whether or not outOfOrderDelivery specified in TS 38.323 [5] is configured. This field should be either always present or always absent, after the radio bearer is established.
pdcp-Duplication
Indicates whether or not uplink duplication status at the time of receiving this IE is configured and activated as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The presence of this field indicates that duplication is configured. PDCP duplication is not configured for CA packet duplication of LTE RLC bearer. The value of this field, when the field is present, indicates the state of the duplication at the time of receiving this IE. If set to true, duplication is activated. The value of this field is always true, when configured for a SRB. For PDCP entity with more than two associated RLC entities for UL transmission, this field is always present. If the field moreThanTwoRLC-DRB is present, the value of this field is ignored and the state of the duplication is indicated by duplicationState. For PDCP entity with more than two associated RLC entities, only NR RLC bearer is supported.
pdcp-SN-SizeDL
PDCP sequence number size for downlink, 12 or 18 bits, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For SRBs only the value len12bits is applicable. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
pdcp-SN-SizeUL
PDCP sequence number size for uplink, 12 or 18 bits, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For SRBs only the value len12bits is applicable. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
primaryPath
Indicates the cell group ID and LCID of the primary RLC entity as specified in TS 38.323 [5], clause 5.2.1 for UL data transmission when more than one RLC entity is associated with the PDCP entity. In this version of the specification, only cell group ID corresponding to MCG is supported for SRBs. The NW indicates cellGroup for split bearers using logical channels in different cell groups. The NW always indicates logicalChannel if CA based PDCP duplication is configured in the cell group indicated by cellGroup of this field.
splitSecondaryPath
Indicates the LCID of the split secondary RLC entity as specified in TS 38.323 [5] for fallback to split bearer operation when UL data transmission with more than two RLC entities is associated with the PDCP entity. This RLC entity belongs to a cell group that is different from the cell group indicated by cellGroup in the field primaryPath.
statusReportRequired
For AM DRBs and DAPS UM DRBs, indicates whether the DRB is configured to send a PDCP status report in the uplink, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For DAPS AM DRBs, it also indicates whether the DRB is configured to send a second PDCP status report in the uplink, as specified in TS 38.323 [5].
t-Reordering
Value in ms of t-Reordering specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms0 corresponds to 0 ms, value ms20 corresponds to 20 ms, value ms40 corresponds to 40 ms, and so on.  When the field is absent the UE applies the value infinity. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
ul-DataSplitThreshold
Parameter specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value b0 corresponds to 0 bytes, value b100 corresponds to 100 bytes, value b200 corresponds to 200 bytes, and so on. The network sets this field to infinity for UEs not supporting splitDRB-withUL-Both-MCG-SCG. If the field is absent when the split bearer is configured for the radio bearer first time, then the default value infinity is applied.

EthernetHeaderCompression field descriptions
drb-ContinueEHC-DL
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the downlink EHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated.
drb-ContinueEHC-UL
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the uplink EHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated.
ehc-CID-Length
Indicates the length of the CID field for EHC packet. The value bits7 indicates the length is 7 bits, and the value bits15 indicates the length is 15 bits. Once the field ethernetHeaderCompression-r16 is configured for a DRB, the value of the field ehc-CID-Length for this DRB is not reconfigured to a different value.
ehc-Common
Indicates the configurations that apply for both downlink and uplink.
ehc-Downlink
Indicates the configurations that apply for only downlink. If the field is configured, then Ethernet header compression is configured for downlink. Otherwise, it is not configured for downlink.

PHR-Config field descriptions
dummy
This field is not used in this version of the specification and the UE ignores the received value.
mpe-ProhibitTimer
Value in number of subframes for MPE reporting, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value sf10 corresponds to 10 subframes, and so on.
mpe-Reporting-FR2
Indicates whether the UE shall report MPE P-MPR in the PHR MAC control element, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
mpe-Threshold
Value of the P-MPR threshold in dB for reporting MPE P-MPR when FR2 is configured, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. The same value applies for each serving cell (although the associated functionality is performed independently for each cell).
multiplePHR
Indicates if power headroom shall be reported using the Single Entry PHR MAC control element or Multiple Entry PHR MAC control element defined in TS 38.321 [3]. True means to use Multiple Entry PHR MAC control element and False means to use the Single Entry PHR MAC control element defined in TS 38.321 [3]. The network configures this field to true for MR-DC and UL CA for NR, and to false in all other cases.
phr-ModeOtherCG
Indicates the mode (i.e. real or virtual) used for the PHR of the activated cells that are part of the other Cell Group (i.e. MCG or SCG), when DC is configured. If the UE is configured with only one cell group (no DC), it ignores the field.
phr-PeriodicTimer
Value in number of subframes for PHR reporting as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value sf10 corresponds to 10 subframes, value sf20 corresponds to 20 subframes, and so on.
phr-ProhibitTimer
Value in number of subframes for PHR reporting as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value sf0 corresponds to 0 subframe, value sf10 corresponds to 10 subframes, value sf20 corresponds to 20 subframes, and so on.
phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange
Value in dB for PHR reporting as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value dB1 corresponds to 1 dB, dB3 corresponds to 3 dB and so on. The same value applies for each serving cell (although the associated functionality is performed independently for each cell).
phr-Type2OtherCell
If set to true, the UE shall report a PHR type 2 for the SpCell of the other MAC entity. See TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.4.6. Network sets this field to false if the UE is not configured with an E-UTRA MAC entity.

Indicates the uplink power sharing mode that the UE uses in NR-DC in frequency range 2 (FR2) (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.6).
pdcch-BlindDetection, pdcch-BlindDetection2, pdcch-BlindDetection3
Indicates the reference number of cells for PDCCH blind detection for the CG. Network configures the field for each CG when the UE is in NR DC and sets the value in accordance with the constraints specified in TS 38.213 [13]. The network configures pdcch-BlindDetection only if the UE is in NR-DC. The network configures pdcch-BlindDetection2 only if the UE is in NR-DC with at least one downlink cell using Rel-16 PDCCH monitoring capability. The network configures pdcch-BlindDetection3 only if the UE is in NR-DC with at least one downlink cell using Rel-15 PDCCH monitoring capability.
pdcch-BlindDetectionCA-CombIndicator
Configure one combination of pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1 (for R15) and pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2 (for R16) for UE to use for scaling PDCCH monitoring capability if the number of serving cells configured to a UE is larger than the reported capability, and if UE reports more than one combination of pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1 and pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2 as UE capability. The combination of pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1 and pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2) configured by pdcch-BlindDetectionCACombIndicator is from the more than one combination of pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1 and pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2 reported by UE (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10).
p-NR-FR1
The maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in this NR cell group across all serving cells in frequency range 1 (FR1). The maximum transmit power that the UE may use may be additionally limited by p-Max (configured in FrequencyInfoUL) and by p-UE-FR1 (configured total for all serving cells operating on FR1).
p-NR-FR2
The maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in this NR cell group across all serving cells in frequency range 2 (FR2). The maximum transmit power that the UE may use may be additionally limited by p-Max (configured in FrequencyInfoUL) and by p-UE-FR2 (configured total for all serving cells operating on FR2). This field is only used in NR-DC.
ps-RNTI
RNTI value for scrambling CRC of DCI format 2-6 used for power saving (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
ps-Offset
The start of the search-time of DCI format 2-6 with CRC scrambled by PS-RNTI relative to the start of the drx-onDurationTimer of Long DRX (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.3). Value in multiples of 0.125ms (milliseconds). 1 corresponds to 0.125 ms, 2 corresponds to 0.25 ms, 3 corresponds to 0.375 ms and so on.
ps-WakeUp
Indicates the UE to wake-up if DCI format 2-6 is not detected outside active time (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.7). If the field is absent, the UE does not wake-up if DCI format 2-6 is not detected outside active time.
ps-PositionDCI-2-6
Starting position of UE wakeup and SCell dormancy indication in DCI format 2-6 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.3).
ps-TransmitPeriodicL1-RSRP
Indicates the UE to transmit periodic L1-RSRP report(s) when the drx-onDurationTimer does not start (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.7). If the field is absent, the UE does not transmit periodic L1-RSRP report(s) when the drx-onDurationTimer does not start.
ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI
Indicates the UE to transmit periodic CSI report(s) other than L1-RSRP reports when the drx-onDurationTimer does not start (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.7). If the field is absent, the UE does not transmit periodic CSI report(s) other than L1-RSRP reports when the drx-onDurationTimer does not start.
p-UE-FR1
The maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE across all serving cells in frequency range 1 (FR1) across all cell groups. The maximum transmit power that the UE may use may be additionally limited by p-Max (configured in FrequencyInfoUL) and by p-NR-FR1 (configured for the cell group).
p-UE-FR2
The maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE across all serving cells in frequency range 2 (FR2) across all cell groups. The maximum transmit power that the UE may use may be additionally limited by p-Max (configured in FrequencyInfoUL) and by p-NR-FR2 (configured for the cell group).

The PDSCH HARQ-ACK codebook is either semi-static or dynamic. This is applicable to both CA and none CA operation (see TS 38.213 [13], clauses 9.1.2 and 9.1.3). If pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16 is signalled, UE shall ignore the pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook (without suffix). For the HARQ-ACK for sidelink, if pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16 is signalled, the UE uses pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook (without suffix) and ignores pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16. If the field pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-secondaryPUCCHgroup is present, pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook is applied to primary PUCCH group. Otherwise, this field is applied to the cell group (i.e. for all the cells within the cell group). For the HARQ-ACK for sidelink, if the field pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-secondaryPUCCHgroup is present, pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook is applied to primary and secondary PUCCH group and the UE ignores pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-secondaryPUCCHgroup.

A list of configurations for one or two HARQ-ACK codebooks. Each configuration in the list is defined in the same way as pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1.2.2 and TS 38.213 [13], clauses 7.2.1, 9.1.2, 9.1.3 and 9.2.1). If this field is present, the field pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook is ignored. If this field is present, the value of this field is applied for primary PUCCH group and for secondary PUCCH group (if configured). For the HARQ-ACK for sidelink, the UE uses pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook and ignores pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList if this field is present.
pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-secondaryPUCCHgroup
The PDSCH HARQ-ACK codebook is either semi-static or dynamic. This is applicable to CA operation (see TS 38.213 [13], clauses 9.1.2 and 9.1.3). It is configured for secondary PUCCH group.
pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback
When configured, the DCI_format 1_1 can request the UE to report A/N for all HARQ processes and all CCs configured in the PUCCH group (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1).
pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedbackCBG
When configured, the DCI_format 1_1 can request the UE to include CBG level A/N for each CC with CBG level transmission configured. When not configured, the UE will report TB level A/N even if CBG level transmission is configured for a CC. The network configures this only when pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback is configured.
pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedbackNDI
When configured, the DCI_format 1_1 can request the UE to include NDI for each A/N reported. The network configures this only when pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback is configured.
sizeDCI-2-6
Size of DCI format 2-6 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.5).
sp-CSI-RNTI
RNTI for Semi-Persistent CSI reporting on PUSCH (see CSI-ReportConfig) (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.5.2). Network always configures the UE with a value for this field when at least one CSI-ReportConfig with reportConfigType set to semiPersistentOnPUSCH is configured.
tpc-PUCCH-RNTI
RNTI used for PUCCH TPC commands on DCI (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
tpc-PUSCH-RNTI
RNTI used for PUSCH TPC commands on DCI (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
tpc-SRS-RNTI
RNTI used for SRS TPC commands on DCI (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
ul-TotalDAI-Included
Indicates whether the total DAI fields of the additonal PDSCH group is included in the non-fallback UL grant DCI (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1). The network configures this only when enhanced dynamic codebook is configured (pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook is set to enhancedDynamic).
xScale
The UE is allowed to drop NR only if the power scaling applied to NR results in a difference between scaled and unscaled NR UL of more than xScale dB (see TS 38.213 [13]). If the value is not configured for dynamic power sharing, the UE assumes default value of 6 dB.

PUCCH-Resource, PUCCH-ResourceExt field descriptions
format, formatExt
Selection of the PUCCH format (format 0 – 4) and format-specific parameters, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2. format0 and format1 are only allowed for a resource in a first PUCCH resource set. format2, format3 and format4 are only allowed for a resource in non-first PUCCH resource set. The network can only configure formatExt when format is set to format2 or format3.
interlace0
This is the only interlace of interlaced PUCCH Format 0 and 1 and the first interlace for interlaced PUCCH Format 2 and 3.
interlace1
A second interlace, in addition to interlace 0, as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1. For 15KHz SCS, values {0..9} are applicable; for 30Khz SCS, values {0..4} are applicable. For 15kHz SCS, the values of interlace1 shall satisfy interlace1=mod(interlace0+X,10) where X=1, -1, or 5.
intraSlotFrequencyHopping
Enabling intra-slot frequency hopping, applicable for all types of PUCCH formats. For long PUCCH over multiple slots, the intra and inter slot frequency hopping cannot be enabled at the same time for a UE. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1.
occ-Index
Indicates the orthogonal cover code index (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1). This field is Applicable when useInterlacePUCCH-Dedicated-r16 is configured.
occ-Length
Indicates the orthogonal cover code length (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1). Applicable when useInterlacePUCCH-Dedicated-r16 is configured.
pucch-ResourceId
Identifier of the PUCCH resource.
secondHopPRB
Index of first PRB after frequency hopping of PUCCH. This value is applicable for intra-slot frequency hopping (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1) or inter-slot frequency hopping (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.6).

PUCCH-ResourceSet field descriptions
maxPayloadSize
Maximum number of UCI information bits that the UE may transmit using this PUCCH resource set (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1). In a PUCCH occurrence, the UE chooses the first of its PUCCH-ResourceSet which supports the number of bits that the UE wants to transmit. The field is absent in the first set (Set0) and in the last configured set since the UE derives the maximum number of UCI information bits as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1. This field can take integer values that are multiples of 4.
resourceList
PUCCH resources of format0 and format1 are only allowed in the first PUCCH resource set, i.e., in a PUCCH-ResourceSet with pucch-ResourceSetId = 0. This set may contain between 1 and 32 resources. PUCCH resources of format2, format3 and format4 are only allowed in a PUCCH-ResourceSet with pucch-ResourceSetId > 0. If present, these sets contain between 1 and 8 resources each. The UE chooses a PUCCH-Resource from this list as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.3. Note that this list contains only a list of resource IDs. The actual resources are configured in PUCCH-Config.

Conditional Presence
Explanation

RACH-ConfigCommon field descriptions
messagePowerOffsetGroupB
Threshold for preamble selection. Value is in dB. Value minusinfinity corresponds to –infinity. Value dB0 corresponds to 0 dB, dB5 corresponds to 5 dB and so on. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2)
msg1-SubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing of PRACH (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.2). Only the values 15 or 30 kHz (FR1), and 60 or 120 kHz (FR2) are applicable. If absent, the UE applies the SCS as derived from the prach-ConfigurationIndex in RACH-ConfigGeneric (see tables Table 6.3.3.1-1, Table 6.3.3.1-2, Table 6.3.3.2-2 and Table 6.3.3.2-3, TS 38.211 [16]). The value also applies to contention free random access (RACH-ConfigDedicated), to SI-request and to contention-based beam failure recovery (CB-BFR). But it does not apply for contention free beam failure recovery (CF-BFR) (see BeamFailureRecoveryConfig).
msg3-transformPrecoder
Enables the transform precoder for Msg3 transmission according to clause 6.1.3 of TS 38.214 [19]. If the field is absent, the UE disables the transformer precoder (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.3).
numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA
The number of CB preambles per SSB in group A. This determines implicitly the number of CB preambles per SSB available in group B. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). The setting should be consistent with the setting of ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB.
prach-RootSequenceIndex
PRACH root sequence index (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.1). The value range depends on whether L=839 or L=139 or L=571 or L=1151. The length of the root sequence corresponding with the index indicated in this IE should be consistent with the one indicated in prach-ConfigurationIndex in the RACH-ConfigDedicated (if configured). If prach-RootSequenceIndex-r16 is signalled, UE shall ignore the prach-RootSequenceIndex (without suffix).
ra-ContentionResolutionTimer
The initial value for the contention resolution timer (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.5). Value sf8 corresponds to 8 subframes, value sf16 corresponds to 16 subframes, and so on.
ra-Msg3SizeGroupA
Transport Blocks size threshold in bits below which the UE shall use a contention-based RA preamble of group A. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2).
ra-Prioritization
Parameters which apply for prioritized random access procedure on any UL BWP of SpCell for specific Access Identities (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1a).
ra-PrioritizationForAI
Indicates whether the field ra-Prioritization-r16 applies for Access Identities. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to Access Identity 1, the next bit corresponds to Access Identity 2. Value 1 indicates that the field ra-Prioritization-r16 applies otherwise the field does not apply (see TS 23.501 [32]).
rach-ConfigGeneric
RACH parameters for both regular random access and beam failure recovery.
restrictedSetConfig
Configuration of an unrestricted set or one of two types of restricted sets, see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.1.
rsrp-ThresholdSSB
UE may select the SS block and corresponding PRACH resource for path-loss estimation and (re)transmission based on SS blocks that satisfy the threshold (see TS 38.213 [13]).
rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL
The UE selects SUL carrier to perform random access based on this threshold (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). The value applies to all the BWPs.
ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB
The meaning of this field is twofold: the CHOICE conveys the information about the number of SSBs per RACH occasion. Value oneEighth corresponds to one SSB associated with 8 RACH occasions, value oneFourth corresponds to one SSB associated with 4 RACH occasions, and so on. The ENUMERATED part indicates the number of Contention Based preambles per SSB. Value n4 corresponds to 4 Contention Based preambles per SSB, value n8 corresponds to 8 Contention Based preambles per SSB, and so on. The total number of CB preambles in a RACH occasion is given by CB-preambles-per-SSB * max(1, SSB-per-rach-occasion). See TS 38.213 [13].
totalNumberOfRA-Preambles
Total number of preambles used for contention based and contention free 4-step or 2-step random access in the RACH resources defined in RACH-ConfigCommon, excluding preambles used for other purposes (e.g. for SI request). If the field is absent, all 64 preambles are available for RA. The setting should be consistent with the setting of ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB, i.e. it should be a multiple of the number of SSBs per RACH occasion.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
L139
The field is mandatory present if prach-RootSequenceIndex L=139, otherwise the field is absent, Need S.
SUL
The field is mandatory present in initialUplinkBWP if supplementaryUplink is configured in ServingCellConfigCommonSIB or if supplementaryUplinkConfig is configured in ServingCellConfigCommon; otherwise, the field is absent.
InitialBWP-Only
This field is optionally present, Need R, if this BWP is the initial BWP of SpCell. Otherwise the field is absent.

RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA field descriptions
groupB-ConfiguredTwoStepRA
Preamble grouping for 2-step random access type. If the field is absent then there is only one preamble group configured and only one msgA PUSCH configuration.
msgA-CB-PreamblesPerSSB-PerSharedRO
Number of contention-based preambles used for 2-step RA type from the non-CBRA 4-step type preambles associated with each SSB for RO shared with 4-step type RA. The number of preambles for 2-step RA type shall not exceed the number of preambles per SSB minus the number of contention-based preambles per SSB for 4-step type RA. The possible value range for this parameter needs to be aligned with value range for the configured SSBs per RACH occasion in ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB in RACH-ConfigCommon. The field is only applicable for the case of shared ROs with 4-step type random access.
msgA-PRACH-RootSequenceIndex
PRACH root sequence index. If the field is not configured, the UE applies the value in field prach-RootSequenceIndex in RACH-ConfigCommon in the configured BWP. When both 2-step and 4-step type random access is configured, this field is only configured for the case of separate ROs between 2-step and 4-step type random access.
msgA-RestrictedSetConfig
Configuration of an unrestricted set or one of two types of restricted sets for 2-step random access type preamble. If the field is not configured, the UE applies the value in field restrictedSetConfig in RACH-ConfigCommon in the configured BWP. When both 2-step and 4-step type random access is configured, this field is only configured for the case of separate ROs between 2-step and 4-step type random access.
msgA-RSRP-Threshold
The UE selects 2-step random access type to perform random access based on this threshold (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). This field is only present if both 2-step and 4-step RA type are configured for the BWP.
msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB
UE may select the SS block and corresponding PRACH resource for path-loss estimation and (re)transmission based on SS blocks that satisfy the threshold (see TS 38.213 [13]).
msgA-SSB-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB
The meaning of this field is twofold: the CHOICE conveys the information about the number of SSBs per RACH occasion. Value oneEight corresponds to one SSB associated with 8 RACH occasions, value oneFourth corresponds to one SSB associated with 4 RACH occasions, and so on. The ENUMERATED part indicates the number of Contention Based preambles per SSB. Value n4 corresponds to 4 Contention Based preambles per SSB, value n8 corresponds to 8 Contention Based preambles per SSB, and so on. The total number of CB preambles in a RACH occasion is given by CB-preambles-per-SSB * max(1, SSB-per-rach-occasion). If the field is not configured and both 2-step and 4-step are configured for the BWP, the UE applies the value in the field ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB in RACH-ConfigCommon. The field is not present when RACH occasions are shared between 2-step and 4-step type random access in the BWP.
msgA-SSB-SharedRO-MaskIndex
Indicates the subset of 4-step type ROs shared with 2-step random access type for each SSB. This field is configured when there is more than one RO per SSB. If the field is absent, and 4-step and 2-step has shared ROs, then all ROs are shared.
msgA-SubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing of PRACH (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.2). Only the values 15 or 30 kHz (FR1), and 60 or 120 kHz (FR2) are applicable. The field is only present in case of 2-step only BWP, otherwise the UE applies the SCS as derived from the msg1-SubcarrierSpacing in RACH-ConfigCommon. The value also applies to contention free 2-step random access type (RACH-ConfigDedicated).
msgA-TotalNumberOfRA-Preambles
Indicates the total number of preambles used for contention-based and contention-free 2-step random access type when ROs for 2-step are not shared with 4-step. If the field is absent, and 2-step and 4-step does not have shared ROs, all 64 preambles are available for 2-step random access type.
msgA-TransMax
Max number of MsgA preamble transmissions performed before switching to 4-step random access (see TS 38.321 [3], clauses 5.1.1). This field is only applicable when 2-step and 4-step RA type are configured and switching to 4-step type RA is supported. If the field is absent, switching from 2-step RA type to 4-step RA type is not allowed.
ra-ContentionResolutionTimer
The initial value for the contention resolution timer for fallback RAR in case no 4-step random access type is configured (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.5). Value sf8 corresponds to 8 subframes, value sf16 corresponds to 16 subframes, and so on. If both 2-step and 4-step random access type resources are configured on the BWP, then this field is absent.
ra-Prioritization
Parameters which apply for prioritized random access procedure on any UL BWP of SpCell for specific Access Identities (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1a).
ra-PrioritizationForAI
Indicates whether the field ra-Prioritization-r16 applies for Access Identities. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to Access Identity 1, the next bit corresponds to Access Identity 2. Value 1 for an Access Identity indicates that the field ra-Prioritization-r16 applies, otherwise the field does not apply.
rach-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA
2-step random access type parameters for both regular random access and beam failure recovery.

GroupB-ConfiguredTwoStepRA field descriptions
messagePowerOffsetGroupB
Threshold for preamble selection. Value is in dB. Value minusinfinity corresponds to –infinity. Value dB0 corresponds to 0 dB, dB5 corresponds to 5 dB and so on. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1).
numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA
The number of CB preambles per SSB in group A for idle/inactive or connected mode. The setting of the number of preambles for each group should be consistent with msgA-SSB-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB or msgA-CB-PreamblesPerSSB-PerSharedRO if configured.
ra-MsgA-SizeGroupA
Transport block size threshold in bits below which the UE shall use a contention-based RA preamble of group A. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1).

DRB-ToAddMod field descriptions
cnAssociation
Indicates if the bearer is associated with the eps-bearerIdentity (when connected to EPC) or sdap-Config (when connected to 5GC).
daps-Config
Indicates that the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
drb-Identity
In case of DC, the DRB identity is unique within the scope of the UE, i.e. an MCG DRB cannot use the same value as a split DRB. For a split DRB the same identity is used for the MCG and SCG parts of the configuration.
eps-BearerIdentity
The EPS bearer ID determines the EPS bearer.
reestablishPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should be re-established. Network sets this to true whenever the security key used for this radio bearer changes. Key change could for example be due to termination point change for the bearer, reconfiguration with sync, resuming an RRC connection, or the first reconfiguration after reestablishment. It is also applicable for LTE procedures when NR PDCP is configured. Network doesn't include this field for DRB if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
recoverPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should perform recovery according to TS 38.323 [5]. Network doesn't include this field if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
sdap-Config
The SDAP configuration determines how to map QoS flows to DRBs when NR or E-UTRA connects to the 5GC and presence/absence of UL/DL SDAP headers.

RadioBearerConfig field descriptions
securityConfig
Indicates the security algorithm and key to use for the signalling and data radio bearers configured with the list in this IE RadioBearerConfig. When the field is not included after AS security has been activated, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured keyToUse and security algorithm for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this IE RadioBearerConfig. The field is not included when configuring SRB1 before AS security is activated.
srb3-ToRelease
Release SRB3. SRB3 release can only be done over SRB1 and only at SCG release and reconfiguration with sync.

SecurityConfig field descriptions
keyToUse
Indicates if the bearers configured with the list in this IE RadioBearerConfig are using the master key or the secondary key for deriving ciphering and/or integrity protection keys. For MR-DC, network should not configure SRB1 and SRB2 with secondary key and SRB3 with the master key. When the field is not included, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured keyToUse for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this IE RadioBearerConfig.

Indicates the security algorithm for the signalling and data radio bearers configured with the list in this IE RadioBearerConfig. When the field is not included, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured security algorithm for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this IE RadioBearerConfig.

SRB-ToAddMod field descriptions
discardOnPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should discard stored SDU and PDU according to TS 38.323 [5].
reestablishPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should be re-established. Network sets this to true whenever the security key used for this radio bearer changes. Key change could for example be due to reconfiguration with sync, for SRB2 when resuming an RRC connection, or at the first reconfiguration after RRC connection reestablishment in NR. For SRB1, when resuming an RRC connection, or at the first reconfiguration after RRC connection reestablishment in NR, the network does not set this field to true. For LTE SRBs using NR PDCP, it could be for handover, RRC connection reestablishment or resume. Network doesn't include this field if any DAPS bearer is configured.

RateMatchPattern field descriptions
bitmaps
Indicates rate matching pattern by a pair of bitmaps resourceBlocks and symbolsInResourceBlock to define the rate match pattern within one or two slots, and a third bitmap periodicityAndPattern to define the repetition pattern with which the pattern defined by the above bitmap pair occurs.
controlResourceSet
This ControlResourceSet is used as a PDSCH rate matching pattern, i.e., PDSCH reception rate matches around it. In frequency domain, the resource is determined by the frequency domain resource of the CORESET with the corresponding CORESET ID. Time domain resource is determined by the parameters of the associated search space of the CORESET.
If the field controlResourceSetId-r16 is present, UE shall ignore the controlResourceSetId (without suffix).
periodicityAndPattern
A time domain repetition pattern at which the pattern defined by symbolsInResourceBlock and resourceBlocks recurs. This slot pattern repeats itself continuously. Absence of this field indicates the value n1 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
resourceBlocks
A resource block level bitmap in the frequency domain. A bit in the bitmap set to 1 indicates that the UE shall apply rate matching in the corresponding resource block in accordance with the symbolsInResourceBlock bitmap. If used as cell-level rate matching pattern, the bitmap identifies "common resource blocks (CRB)". If used as BWP-level rate matching pattern, the bitmap identifies "physical resource blocks" inside the BWP. The first/ leftmost bit corresponds to resource block 0, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). 
subcarrierSpacing
The SubcarrierSpacing for this resource pattern. If the field is absent, the UE applies the SCS of the associated BWP. The value kHz15 corresponds to µ=0, the value kHz30 corresponds to µ=1, and so on. Only the values 15 kHz, 30 kHz or 60 kHz (FR1), and 60 kHz or 120 kHz (FR2) are applicable (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
symbolsInResourceBlock
A symbol level bitmap in time domain. It indicates with a bit set to true that the UE shall rate match around the corresponding symbol. This pattern recurs (in time domain) with the configured periodicityAndPattern (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
For oneSlot, if ECP is configured, the first 12 bits represent the symbols within the slot and the last two bits within the bitstring are ignored by the UE; Otherwise, the 14 bits represent the symbols within the slot.
For twoSlots, if ECP is configured, the first 12 bits represent the symbols within the first slot and the next 12 bits represent the symbols in the second slot and the last four bits within the bit string are ignored by the UE; Otherwise, the first 14 bits represent the symbols within the first slot and the next 14 bits represent the symbols in the second slot.
For the bits representing symbols in a slot, the most significant bit of the bit string represents the first symbol in the slot and the second most significant bit represents the second symbol in the slot and so on.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
CellLevel
The field is mandatory present if the RateMatchPattern is defined on cell level. The field is absent when the RateMatchPattern is defined on BWP level. If the RateMatchPattern is defined on BWP level, the UE applies the SCS of the BWP.

ReferenceTimeInfo field descriptions
referenceSFN
This field indicates the reference SFN corresponding to the reference time information. If referenceTimeInfo field is received in DLInformationTransfer message, this field indicates the SFN of PCell.
time
This field indicates time reference with 10ns granularity. The indicated time is referenced at the network, i.e., without compensating for RF propagation delay. The indicated time in 10ns unit from the origin is refDays*86400*1000*100000 + refSeconds*1000*100000 + refMilliSeconds*100000 + refTenNanoSeconds. The refDays field specifies the sequential number of days (with day count starting at 0) from the origin of the time field.
If the referenceTimeInfo field is received in DLInformationTransfer message, the time field indicates the time at the ending boundary of the system frame indicated by referenceSFN. The UE considers this frame (indicated by referenceSFN) to be the frame which is nearest to the frame where the message is received (which can be either in the past or in the future).
If the referenceTimeInfo field is received in SIB9, the time field indicates the time at the SFN boundary at or immediately after the ending boundary of the SI-window in which SIB9 is transmitted.
If referenceTimeInfo field is received in SIB9, this field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of time should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1.
timeInfoType
If timeInfoType is not included, the time indicates the GPS time and the origin of the time field is 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 6 January, 1980 (start of GPS time). If timeInfoType is set to localClock, the origin of the time is unspecified.
uncertainty
This field indicates the uncertainty of the reference time information provided by the time field. The uncertainty is 25ns multiplied by this field. If this field is absent, the uncertainty is unspecified.

Conditional Presence

RepetitionSchemeConfig field descriptions
fdm-TDM
Configures UE with a repetition scheme among fdmSchemeA, fdmSchemeB and tdmSchemeA as specified in clause 5.1 of TS 38.214 [19]. The network does not set this field to release. Upon reception of this field in RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16, the UE shall release slotBased if previously configured in the same instance of RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16.
sequenceOffsetForRV
For slot-based repetition scheme, selected RV sequence is applied to transmission occasions associated to the first TCI state. The RV sequence associated to the second TCI state is determined by a RV offset from that selected RV sequence.
slotBased
Configures UE with slot-based repetition scheme. Network always configures this field when the parameter repetitionNumber is present in IE PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList. The network does not set this field to release. Upon reception of this field in RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16, the UE shall release fdm-TDM if previously configured in the same instance of RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16.
startingSymbolOffsetK
The starting symbol of the second transmission occasion has K symbol offset relative to the last symbol of the first transmission occasion. When UE is configured with tdmSchemeA, the parameter startingSymbolOffsetK is present, otherwise absent.
tciMapping
Enables TCI state mapping method to PDSCH transmission occasions.

ReportConfigInterRAT field descriptions
reportType
Type of the configured measurement report. In (NG)EN-DC, and NR-DC, network does not configure report of type ReportCGI-EUTRA for SCG.

ReportCGI-EUTRA field descriptions
useAutonomousGaps
Indicates whether or not the UE is allowed to use autonomous gaps in acquiring system information from the E-UTRAN neighbour cell. When the field is included, the UE applies the corresponding value for T321.

EventTriggerConfigInterRAT field descriptions
b2-Threshold1
NR threshold to be used in inter RAT measurement report triggering condition for event B2.
bN-ThresholdEUTRA
E-UTRA threshold value associated with the selected trigger quantity (RSRP, RSRQ, SINR) to be used in inter RAT measurement report triggering condition for event number bN. In the same eventB2, the network configures the same CHOICE name (rsrp, rsrq or sinr) for the MeasTriggerQuantity of the b2-Threshold1 and for the MeasTriggerQuantityEUTRA of the b2-Threshold2EUTRA.
eventId
Choice of inter RAT event triggered reporting criteria.
maxReportCells
Max number of non-serving cells to include in the measurement report.
reportAmount
Number of measurement reports applicable for eventTriggered as well as for periodical report types
reportOnLeave
Indicates whether or not the UE shall initiate the measurement reporting procedure when the leaving condition is met for a cell in cellsTriggeredList, as specified in 5.5.4.1.
reportQuantity, reportQuantityUTRA-FDD
The cell measurement quantities to be included in the measurement report. If the field eventB1-UTRA-FDD or eventB2-UTRA-FDD is present, the UE shall ignore the value(s) provided in reportQuantity.
timeToTrigger
Time during which specific criteria for the event needs to be met in order to trigger a measurement report.
bN-ThresholdUTRA-FDD
UTRA-FDD threshold value associated with the selected trigger quantity (RSCP, EcN0) to be used in inter RAT measurement report triggering condition for event number bN.
utra-FDD-RSCP corresponds to CPICH_RSCP in TS 25.133 [46] for FDD. utra-FDD-EcN0 corresponds to CPICH_Ec/No in TS 25.133 [46] for FDD.
For utra-FDD-RSCP: The actual value is field value – 115 dBm.
For utra-FDD-EcN0: The actual value is (field value – 49)/2 dB.

PeriodicalReportConfigInterRAT field descriptions
maxReportCells
Max number of non-serving cells to include in the measurement report.
reportAmount
Number of measurement reports applicable for eventTriggered as well as for periodical report types
reportQuantity, reportQuantityUTRA-FDD
The cell measurement quantities to be included in the measurement report. If the field reportQuantityUTRA-FDD is present, the UE shall ignore the value(s) provided in reportQuantity.

–	ReportConfigNR
The IE ReportConfigNR specifies criteria for triggering of an NR measurement reporting event or of a CHO or CPC event. For events labelled AN with N equal to 1, 2 and so on, measurement reporting events and CHO or CPC events are based on cell measurement results, which can either be derived based on SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS.
Event A1:	Serving becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event A2:	Serving becomes worse than absolute threshold;
Event A3:	Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than PCell/PSCell;
Event A4:	Neighbour becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event A5:	PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND Neighbour/SCell becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
Event A6:	Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than SCell;
CondEvent A3: Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes amount of offset better than PCell/PSCell;
CondEvent A5: PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
For event I1, measurement reporting event is based on CLI measurement results, which can either be derived based on SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI.
Event I1:	Interference becomes higher than absolute threshold.

SDAP-Config field descriptions
defaultDRB
Indicates whether or not this is the default DRB for this PDU session. Among all configured instances of SDAP-Config with the same value of pdu-Session, this field shall be set to true in at most one instance of SDAP-Config and to false in all other instances.
mappedQoS-FlowsToAdd
Indicates the list of QFIs of UL QoS flows of the PDU session to be additionally mapped to this DRB. A QFI value can be included at most once in all configured instances of SDAP-Config with the same value of pdu-Session. For QoS flow remapping, the QFI value of the remapped QoS flow is only included in mappedQoS-FlowsToAdd in sdap-Config corresponding to the new DRB and not included in mappedQoS-FlowsToRelease in sdap-Config corresponding to the old DRB.
mappedQoS-FlowsToRelease
Indicates the list of QFIs of QoS flows of the PDU session to be released from existing QoS flow to DRB mapping of this DRB. 
pdu-Session
Identity of the PDU session whose QoS flows are mapped to the DRB.
sdap-HeaderUL
Indicates whether or not a SDAP header is present for UL data on this DRB. The field cannot be changed after a DRB is established. The network sets this field to present if the field defaultDRB is set to true.
sdap-HeaderDL
Indicates whether or not a SDAP header is present for DL data on this DRB. The field cannot be changed after a DRB is established.

–	SearchSpace
The IE SearchSpace defines how/where to search for PDCCH candidates. Each search space is associated with one ControlResourceSet. For a scheduled cell in the case of cross carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the optional fields are absent (regardless of their presence conditions).

SearchSpace field descriptions
common
Configures this search space as common search space (CSS) and DCI formats to monitor.
controlResourceSetId
The CORESET applicable for this SearchSpace. Value 0 identifies the common CORESET#0 configured in MIB and in ServingCellConfigCommon. Values 1..maxNrofControlResourceSets-1 identify CORESETs configured in System Information or by dedicated signalling. The CORESETs with non-zero controlResourceSetId are configured in the same BWP as this SearchSpace. If the field controlResourceSetId-r16 is present, UE shall ignore the controlResourceSetId (without suffix).
dummy1, dummy2
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
dci-Format0-0-AndFormat1-0
If configured, the UE monitors the DCI formats 0_0 and 1_0 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1.
dci-Format2-0
If configured, UE monitors the DCI format 2_0 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1, 11.1.1.
dci-Format2-1
If configured, UE monitors the DCI format 2_1 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1, 11.2.
dci-Format2-2
If configured, UE monitors the DCI format 2_2 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1, 11.3.
dci-Format2-3
If configured, UE monitors the DCI format 2_3 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1, 11.4
dci-Format2-4
If configured, UE monitors the DCI format 2_4 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.2A.
dci-Format2-5
If configured, IAB-MT monitors the DCI format 2_5 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 14.
dci-Format2-6
If configured, UE monitors the DCI format 2_6 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1, 11.5. DCI format 2_6 can only be configured on the SpCell.
dci-Formats
Indicates whether the UE monitors in this USS for DCI formats 0-0 and 1-0 or for formats 0-1 and 1-1.
dci-FormatsExt
If this field is present, the field dci-Formats is ignored and dci-FormatsExt is used instead to indicate whether the UE monitors in this USS for DCI format 0_2 and 1_2 or formats 0_1 and 1_1 and 0_2 and 1_2 (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). This field is not configured for operation with shared spectrum channel access in this release.
dci-Formats-MT
Indicates whether the IAB-MT monitors the DCI formats 2-5 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 14.
dci-FormatsSL
Indicates whether the UE monitors in this USS for DCI formats 0-0 and 1-0 or for formats 0-1 and 1-1 or for format 3-0 or for format 3-1 or for formats 3-0 and 3-1. If this field is present, the field dci-Formats is ignored and dci-FormatsSL is used.
duration
Number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format 2_0. The UE ignores this field for DCI format 2_0. The maximum valid duration is periodicity-1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset).
For IAB-MT, duration indicates number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the IAB-MT applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format 2_0 and DCI format 2_5. The IAB-MT ignores this field for DCI format 2_0 and DCI format 2_5. The maximum valid duration is periodicity-1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset).
freqMonitorLocations
Defines an association of the search space to multiple monitoring locations in the frequency domain and indicates whether the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is replicated to a specific RB set, see TS 38.213, clause 10.1. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to one RB set, and the leftmost (most significant) bit corresponds to RB set 0 in the BWP. A bit set to 1 indicates that a frequency domain resource allocation replicated from the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is mapped to the RB set.
monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset
Slots for PDCCH Monitoring configured as periodicity and offset. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_1, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2' or 'sl4' are applicable. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_0, only the values ′sl1′, ′sl2′, ′sl4′, ′sl5′, ′sl8′, ′sl10′, ′sl16′, and ′sl20′ are applicable (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_4, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8' and 'sl10' are applicable.
For IAB-MT, If the IAB-MT is configured to monitor DCI format 2_1, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2' or 'sl4' are applicable. If the IAB-MT is configured to monitor DCI format 2_0 or DCI format 2_5, only the values ′sl1′, ′sl2′, ′sl4′, ′sl5′, ′sl8′, ′sl10′, ′sl16′, and ′sl20′ are applicable (see TS 38.213, clause 10).
monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot
The first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in the slots configured for PDCCH monitoring (see monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration). The most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be ignored by the UE or IAB-MT.
For DCI format 2_0, the first one symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE ControlResourceSet) identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 2 symbols, and the first three symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 1 symbol.
See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.
For IAB-MT: For DCI format 2_0 or DCI format 2_5, the first one symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE ControlResourceSet) identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 2 symbols, and the first three symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 1 symbol.
See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.
nrofCandidates-CI
The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-4 for the configured aggregation level. If an aggregation level is absent, the UE does not search for any candidates with that aggregation level. The network configures only one aggregationLevel and the corresponding number of candidates (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
nrofCandidates-SFI
The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-0 for the configured aggregation level. If an aggregation level is absent, the UE does not search for any candidates with that aggregation level. The network configures only one aggregationLevel and the corresponding number of candidates (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.1.1). For a search space configured with freqMonitorLocations-r16, only value ′n1′ is valid.
nrofCandidates
Number of PDCCH candidates per aggregation level. The number of candidates and aggregation levels configured here applies to all formats unless a particular value is specified or a format-specific value is provided (see inside searchSpaceType). If configured in the SearchSpace of a cross carrier scheduled cell, this field determines the number of candidates and aggregation levels to be used on the linked scheduling cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10).
searchSpaceGroupIdList
List of search space group IDs which the search space is associated with. The network configures at most 2 search space groups per BWP where the group ID is either 0 or 1.
searchSpaceId
Identity of the search space. SearchSpaceId = 0 identifies the searchSpaceZero configured via PBCH (MIB) or ServingCellConfigCommon and may hence not be used in the SearchSpace IE. The searchSpaceId is unique among the BWPs of a Serving Cell. In case of cross carrier scheduling, search spaces with the same searchSpaceId in scheduled cell and scheduling cell are linked to each other. The UE applies the search space for the scheduled cell only if the DL BWPs in which the linked search spaces are configured in scheduling cell and scheduled cell are both active.
For an IAB-MT, the search space defines how/where to search for PDCCH candidates for an IAB-MT. Each search space is associated with one ControlResearchSet. For a scheduled cell in the case of cross carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the optional fields are absent.
searchSpaceType
Indicates whether this is a common search space (present) or a UE specific search space as well as DCI formats to monitor for.
ue-Specific
Configures this search space as UE specific search space (USS). The UE monitors the DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI (if configured), and SP-CSI-RNTI (if configured)

Conditional Presence
Explanation
Setup
This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new SearchSpace. It is optionally present, Need M, otherwise.
Setup2
This field is mandatory present when a new SearchSpace is set up, if the same SearchSpace ID is not included in searchSpacesToAddModListExt-r16 of the parent IE with the field searchSpaceType-r16 included. Otherwise it is optionally present, Need M.
Setup3
This field is mandatory present when a new SearchSpace is set up, if the same SearchSpace ID is not included in searchSpacesToAddModListExt (without suffix) of the parent IE with the field searchSpaceType (without suffix) included.  Otherwise it is optionally present, Need M.
SetupOnly
This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new SearchSpace. It is absent, Need M, otherwise.
SetupOnly2
In PDCCH-Config, the field is optionally present upon creation of a new SearchSpace and absent, Need M upon reconfiguration of an existing SearchSpace.
In PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the field is absent.

–	SearchSpaceId
The IE SearchSpaceId is used to identify Search Spaces. The ID space is used across the BWPs of a Serving Cell. The search space with the SearchSpaceId = 0 identifies the search space configured via PBCH (MIB) and in ServingCellConfigCommon (searchSpaceZero). The number of Search Spaces per BWP is limited to 10 including the common and UE specific Search Spaces.

ServingCellConfigCommon field descriptions
channelAccessMode
If present, this field indicates which channel access procedures to apply for operation with shared spectrum channel access as defined in TS 37.213 [48]. If the field is configured as "semiStatic", the UE shall apply the channel access procedures for semi-static channel occupancy as described in subclause 4.3 in TS 37.213. If the field is configured as "dynamic", the UE shall apply the channel access procedures in TS 37.213, with the exception of subclause 4.3 of TS 37.213.
dmrs-TypeA-Position
Position of (first) DM-RS for downlink (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.1.1) and uplink (TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3).
downlinkConfigCommon
The common downlink configuration of the serving cell, including the frequency information configuration and the initial downlink BWP common configuration. The parameters provided herein should match the parameters configured by MIB and SIB1 (if provided) of the serving cell, with the exception of controlResourceSetZero and searchSpaceZero which can be configured in ServingCellConfigCommon even if MIB indicates that they are absent.
discoveryBurstWindowLength
Indicates the window length of the discovery burst in ms (see TS 37.213 [48]).
longBitmap
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 64 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
lte-CRS-ToMatchAround
Parameters to determine an LTE CRS pattern that the UE shall rate match around.
mediumBitmap
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 8 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
n-TimingAdvanceOffset
The N_TA-Offset to be applied for all uplink transmissions on this serving cell. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value defined for the duplex mode and frequency range of this serving cell. See TS 38.133 [14], table 7.1.2-2.
rateMatchPatternToAddModList
Resources patterns which the UE should rate match PDSCH around. The UE rate matches around the union of all resources indicated in the rate match patterns. Rate match patterns defined here on cell level apply only to PDSCH of the same numerology (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4,1).
shortBitmap
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 4 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
ss-PBCH-BlockPower
Average EPRE of the resources elements that carry secondary synchronization signals in dBm that the NW used for SSB transmission, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.
ssb-periodicityServingCell
The SSB periodicity in ms for the rate matching purpose. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value ms5. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1)
ssb-PositionQCL
Indicates the QCL relation between SSB positions for this serving cell as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
ssb-PositionsInBurst
For operation in licensed spectrum, indicates the time domain positions of the transmitted SS-blocks in a half frame with SS/PBCH blocks as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 0, the second bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 1, and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is not transmitted while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is transmitted. The network configures the same pattern in this field as in the corresponding field in ServingCellConfigCommonSIB.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, only mediumBitmap is used and the UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst may be transmitted within the discovery burst transmission window and have candidate SS/PBCH blocks indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1). If the k-th bit of ssb-PositionsInBurst is set to 1, the UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks within the discovery burst transmission window with candidate SS/PBCH block indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block index equal to k – 1 may be transmitted; if the kt-th bit is set to 0, the UE assumes that the corresponding SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted. The k-th bit is set to 0, where k > ssb-PositionQCL and the number of actually transmitted SS/PBCH blocks is not larger than the number of 1's in the bitmap. The network configures the same pattern in this field as in the corresponding field in ServingCellConfigCommonSIB.
ssbSubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing of SSB. Only the values 15 kHz or 30 kHz (FR1), and 120 kHz or 240 kHz (FR2) are applicable.

periodicityAndOffset-p
Periodicity and slot offset for this SRS resource. All values are in "number of slots". Value sl1 corresponds to a periodicity of 1 slot, value sl2 corresponds to a periodicity of 2 slots, and so on. For each periodicity the corresponding offset is given in number of slots. For periodicity sl1 the offset is 0 slots (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, sl1280 and sl2560 cannot be configured.
periodicityAndOffset-sp
Periodicity and slot offset for this SRS resource. All values are in "number of slots". Value sl1 corresponds to a periodicity of 1 slot, value sl2 corresponds to a periodicity of 2 slots, and so on.

longBitmap
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 64 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
mediumBitmap
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 8 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the k-th bit is set to 1, the UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks within the SMTC measurement duration with candidate SS/PBCH block indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block index equal to k – 1 may be transmitted; if the kt-th bit is set to 0, the UE assumes that the corresponding SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted. The k-th bit is set to 0, where k > ssb-PositionQCL-Common and the number of actually transmitted SS/PBCH blocks is not larger than the number of 1's in the bitmap. If ssb-PositionQCL is configured with a value smaller than ssb-PositionQCL-Common, only the leftmost K bits (K = ssb-PositionQCL) are applicable for the corresponding cell.

CA-ParametersNRDC field descriptions
ca-ParametersNR-forDC (with and without suffix)
If this field is present for a band combination, it reports the UE capabilities when NR-DC is configured with the band combination. If a version of this field (i.e., with or without suffix) is absent for a band combination, the corresponding ca-ParametersNR field version in BandCombination is applicable to the UE configured with NR-DC for the band combination. If a version of this field (i.e., with or without suffix) is present for a band combination but does not contain any parameters, the UE does not support the corresponding field version when configured with NR-DC for the band combination.
featureSetCombinationDC
If this field is present for a band combination, it reports the feature set combination supported for the band combination when NR-DC is configured. If this field is absent for a band combination, the featureSetCombination in BandCombination (without suffix) is applicable to the UE configured with NR-DC for the band combination.

CodebookParameters field descriptions
supportedCSI-RS-ResourceListAlt
This field indicates the alternative list of SupportedCSI-RS-Resource supported for each codebook type. The supported CSI-RS resource is indicated by an integer value which pinpoints SupportedCSI-RS-Resource defined in CodebookVariantsList. The value 0 corresponds to the first entry of CodebookVariantsList. The value 1 corresponds to the second entry of CodebookVariantsList, and so on. For each codebook type, the field shall be included in both codebookParametersPerBC and codebookParametersPerBand.

–	FeatureSetCombination
The IE FeatureSetCombination is a two-dimensional matrix of FeatureSet entries.
Each FeatureSetsPerBand contains a list of feature sets applicable to the carrier(s) of one band entry of the associated band combination. Across the associated bands, the UE shall support the combination of FeatureSets at the same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand. All FeatureSetsPerBand in one FeatureSetCombination must have the same number of entries.
The number of FeatureSetsPerBand in the FeatureSetCombination must be equal to the number of band entries in an associated band combination. The first FeatureSetPerBand applies to the first band entry of the band combination, and so on.
Each FeatureSet contains either a pair of NR or E-UTRA feature set IDs for UL and DL.
In case of NR, the actual feature sets for UL and DL are defined in the FeatureSets IE and referred to from here by their ID, i.e., their position in the featureSetsUplink / featureSetsDownlink list in the FeatureSet IE.
In case of E-UTRA, the feature sets referred to from this list are defined in TS 36.331 [10] and conveyed as part of the UE-EUTRA-Capability container.
The FeatureSetUplink and FeatureSetDownlink referred to from the FeatureSet comprise, among other information, a set of FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Ids and FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Ids. The number of these per-CC IDs determines the number of carriers that the UE is able to aggregate contiguously in frequency domain in the corresponding band. The number of carriers supported by the UE is also restricted by the bandwidth class indicated in the associated BandCombination, if present.
In feature set combinations the UE shall exclude entries with same or lower capabilities, since the network may anyway assume that the UE supports those.
NOTE 1:	The UE may advertise fallback band-combinations in which it supports additional functionality explicitly in two ways: Either by setting FeatureSet IDs to zero (inter-band and intra-band non-contiguous fallback) and by reducing the number of FeatureSet-PerCC Ids in a Feature Set (intra-band contiguous fallback). Or by separate BandCombination entries with associated FeatureSetCombinations.
NOTE 2:	The UE may advertise a FeatureSetCombination containing only fallback band combinations. That means, in a FeatureSetCombination, each group of FeatureSets across the bands may contain at least one pair of FeatureSetUplinkId and FeatureSetDownlinkId which is set to 0/0.
NOTE 3:	The Network configures serving cell(s) and BWP(s) configuration to comply with capabilities derived from the combination of FeatureSets at the same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand, regardless of activated/deactivated serving cell(s) and BWP(s).

–	FeatureSetCombinationId
The IE FeatureSetCombinationId identifies a FeatureSetCombination. The FeatureSetCombinationId of a FeatureSetCombination is the position of the FeatureSetCombination in the featureSetCombinations list (in UE-NR-Capability or UE-MRDC-Capability). The FeatureSetCombinationId = 0 refers to the first entry in the featureSetCombinations list (in UE-NR-Capability or UE-MRDC-Capability).
NOTE:	The FeatureSetCombinationId = 1024 is not used due to the maximum entry number of featureSetCombinations.

FeatureSetDownlink field descriptions
featureSetListPerDownlinkCC
Indicates which features the UE supports on the individual DL carriers of the feature set (and hence of a band entry that refer to the feature set). The UE shall hence include at least as many FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Id in this list as the number of carriers it supports according to the ca-BandwidthClassDL, except if indicating additional functionality by reducing the number of FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Id in the feature set (see NOTE 1 in FeatureSetCombination IE description). The order of the elements in this list is not relevant, i.e., the network may configure any of the carriers in accordance with any of the FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Id in this list.
supportedSRS-Resources
Indicates supported SRS resources for SRS carrier switching to the band associated with this FeatureSetDownlink. The UE is only allowed to set this field for a band with associated FeatureSetUplinkId set to 0.

–	FeatureSetDownlinkId
The IE FeatureSetDownlinkId identifies a downlink feature set. The FeatureSetDownlinkId of a FeatureSetDownlink is the index position of the FeatureSetDownlink in the featureSetsDownlink list in the FeatureSets IE. The first element in that list is referred to by FeatureSetDownlinkId = 1. The FeatureSetDownlinkId=0 is not used by an actual FeatureSetDownlink but means that the UE does not support a carrier in this band of a band combination.

–	FeatureSets
The IE FeatureSets is used to provide pools of downlink and uplink features sets. A FeatureSetCombination refers to the IDs of the feature set(s) that the UE supports in that FeatureSetCombination. The BandCombination entries in the BandCombinationList then indicate the ID of the FeatureSetCombination that the UE supports for that band combination.
The entries in the lists in this IE are identified by their index position. For example, the FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id = 4 identifies the 4th element in the featureSetsUplinkPerCC list.
NOTE:	When feature sets (per CC) IEs require extension in future versions of the specification, new versions of the FeatureSetDownlink, FeatureSetUplink, FeatureSets, FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC and/or FeatureSetUplinkPerCC will be created and instantiated in corresponding new lists in the FeatureSets IE. For example, if new capability bits are to be added to the FeatureSetDownlink, they will instead be defined in a new FeatureSetDownlink-rxy which will be instantiated in a new featureSetDownlinkList-rxy list. If a UE indicates in a FeatureSetCombination that it supports the FeatureSetDownlink with ID #5, it implies that it supports both the features in FeatureSetDownlink #5 and FeatureSetDownlink-rxy #5 (if present). The number of entries in the new list(s) shall be the same as in the original list(s).

FeatureSetUplink field descriptions
featureSetListPerUplinkCC
Indicates which features the UE supports on the individual UL carriers of the feature set (and hence of a band entry that refers to the feature set). The UE shall hence include at least as many FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id in this list as the number of carriers it supports according to the ca-BandwidthClassUL, except if indicating additional functionality by reducing the number of FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id in the feature set (see NOTE 1 in FeatureSetCombination IE description). The order of the elements in this list is not relevant, i.e., the network may configure any of the carriers in accordance with any of the FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id in this list.

–	FeatureSetUplinkId
The IE FeatureSetUplinkId identifies an uplink feature set. The FeatureSetUplinkId of a FeatureSetUplink is the index position of the FeatureSetUplink in the featureSetsUplink list in the FeatureSets IE. The first element in the list is referred to by FeatureSetUplinkId = 1, and so on. The FeatureSetUplinkId =0 is not used by an actual FeatureSetUplink but means that the UE does not support a carrier in this band of a band combination.

The mode of NR-DC operation that the NW is interested in for this cell grouping. The value sync means that the UE only indicates NR-DC support for band combinations for which it supports synchronous NR-DC with the requested cell grouping. The value async means that the UE only indicates NR-DC support for band combinations for which it supports asynchronous NR-DC with the requested cell grouping.
omitEN-DC
Only if this field is present, the UE shall omit band combinations and feature set combinations which are only applicable to (NG)EN-DC.
requestedCellGrouping
The NR-DC cell groupings that the NW is interested in, i.e., the bands that it might use in an MCG and the bands that it might use in an SCG. Only if this field is present, the UE indicates NR-DC support for band combinations for which it supports the requested cell grouping, i.e., in which it supports at least one of the mcg bands on MCG and at least one of the scg bands on the SCG. In its supportedBandCombinationList, the UE indicates which of its NR-DC band combinations supports which of the requested cell groupings. The first element in this list is referred to by ID#0, the second by ID#1 and so on. If this field is absent, the UE only includes band combinations for which it supports NR-DC with only FR1 bands in MCG and only FR2 bands in SCG.
Example 1: requestedCellGrouping is set to mcg=[n1, n7, n41, n66] and scg=[n78, n261]. This assumes that the NW would always use CA among n1, n7, n41 and n66 (depending on which are deployed on a given site) whereas with n78 and/or n261 the NW may need to use DC. With this filter a UE may report a band combination n1A-n7A-n78A for NR-DC only if it supports that serving cells for n1 and n7 are in the MCG and a serving cell for n78 is in the SCG. The UE may also report a band combination n41C-n261M for NR-DC provided that it supports a serving cell for n41 in the MCG and a serving cell for n261 in the SCG.
Example 2: One requestedCellGrouping is set to mcg=[n1, n7, n41, n66] and scg=[n78, n261] and another requestedCellGrouping is set to mcg=[n1, n7, n66] and scg=[ n41, n78, n261]. This assumes that the NW uses sometimes CA among n1, n7, n41 and n66 (as in example 1) and sometimes CA among n1, n7 and n66 but DC towards one or several of n41, n78, n261. If a UE supports n1A-n41A-n78A only if n41A and n78A are in the same cell group, this UE may only indicate cell grouping ID#1 (not #0) in its BC.
uplinkTxSwitchRequest
Only if this field is present, the UE supporting dynamic UL Tx switching shall indicate support for UL Tx switching in band combinations which are applicable to inter-band UL CA, SUL and (NG)EN-DC.

8	Protocol data unit abstract syntax
8.1	General
The RRC PDU contents in clause 6 and clause 10 are described using abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680 [6] and X.681 [7]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [8].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in X.691:
-	When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to 15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field;
NOTE:	The terms 'leading bit' and 'trailing bit' are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.680. When using the 'bstring' notation, the leading bit of the bit string value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the right.
-	When decoding types constrained with the ASN.1 Contents Constraint ("CONTAINING"), automatic decoding of the contained type should not be performed because errors in the decoding of the contained type should not cause the decoding of the entire RRC message PDU to fail. It is recommended that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that contains the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint, and then decodes the contained type that is nested within the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING as a separate step;
-	When decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC message PDU, BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
8.2	Structure of encoded RRC messages
An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer entities/across the radio interface contains the basic production as defined in X.691.
RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC SDUs (in case of PCCH, BCCH or CCCH) upon transmission and reception as follows:
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the RLC SDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of the PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the RLC SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.
8.3	Basic production
The 'basic production' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the abstract syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It always contains a multiple of 8 bits.
8.4	Extension
The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol extensions:
-	A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall, unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the extension part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may send non-empty extensions;
-	A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall set spare bits to zero.
8.5	Padding
If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC layer shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH and BCCH.
Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a multiple of 8.

Figure 8.5-1: RRC level padding
9	Specified and default radio configurations
Specified and default configurations are configurations of which the details are specified in the standard. Specified configurations are fixed while default configurations can be modified using dedicated signalling. The default value for the parameters not listed in following subclauses shall be set such as the corresponding features are not configured, i.e. release or false unless explicitly stated otherwise.
NOTE:	The UE applies the default values specified in the field description of ASN.1 parameters only when the parent IE is present. Hence, the UE does not apply all default values in field descriptions when it applies the "default radio configuration" in accordance with this clause.

9.1.2	Void
9.2	Default radio configurations
The following clauses only list default values for REL-15 parameters included in protocol version v15.3.0. For all fields introduced in a later protocol version, the default value is "released" or "false" unless explicitly specified otherwise. If the UE is to apply default configuration while it is configured with some critically extended fields, the UE shall apply the original version of those fields with only default values.
NOTE 1:	In general, the signalling should preferably support a "release" option for fields introduced after v15.3.0. The "value not applicable" should be used restrictively, mainly limited to for fields which value is relevant only if another field is set to a value other than its default.
NOTE 2:	For parameters in ServingCellConfig, the default values are specified in the corresponding specification.

10	Generic error handling
10.1	General
The generic error handling defined in the subsequent sub-clauses applies unless explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error handling.
The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
-	to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer syntax supported by the UE;
-	to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved value.
The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
-	as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved field.
10.2	ASN.1 violation or encoding error
The UE shall:
1>	when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, CCCH or PCCH for which the abstract syntax is invalid [6]:
2>	ignore the message.
NOTE:	This clause applies in case one or more fields is set to a value, other than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version of the transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a field defined as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may not be possible to reliably detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message level.
10.3	Field set to a not comprehended value
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1>	if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not comprehend:
2>	if a default value is defined for this field:
3>	treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
2>	else if the concerned field is optional:
3>	treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the need code for absence of the concerned field;
2>	else:
3>	treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with sub-clause 10.4.
10.4	Mandatory field missing
The UE shall:
1>	if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message (e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field is absent or treated as absent:
2>	if the RRC message was not received on DCCH or CCCH:
3>	if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a SEQUENCE OF):
4>	treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended field was absent;
3>	else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as the 'parent' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to the erroneous field:
4>	consider the 'parent' field to be set to a not comprehended value;
4>	apply the generic error handling to the subsequent 'parent' field(s), until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;
3>	else (field at message level):
4>	ignore the message.
NOTE 1:	The error handling defined in these sub-clauses implies that the UE ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not comprehended value.
NOTE 2:	The nested error handling for messages received on logical channels other than DCCH and CCCH applies for errors in extensions also, even for errors that can be regarded as invalid network operation e.g. the network not observing conditional presence.
NOTE 3:	UE behaviour on receipt of an RRC message on DCCH or CCCH that does not include a field that is mandatory (e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) is unspecified.
The following ASN.1 further clarifies the levels applicable in case of nested error handling for errors in extension fields.

ItemInfoList ::=                    SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..max)) OFItemInfo

    nonCriticalExtension                SEQUENCE {}             OPTIONAL            -- Need S
}

-- ASN1STOP

The UE shall, apply the following principles regarding the levels applicable in case of nested error handling:
-	an extension additon group is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the conditionality of field3 would result in the entire itemInfo entry to be ignored (rather than just the extension addition group containing field3 and field4);
-	a traditional nonCriticalExtension is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, an error regarding the conditionality of field3 would result in the entire BroadcastInfoBlock1 to be ignored (rather than just the non-critical extension containing field3 and field4).
10.5	Not comprehended field
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1>	if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
2>	treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent.
NOTE:	This clause does not apply to the case of an extension to the value range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in clause 10.3.
11	Radio information related interactions between network nodes
11.1	General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across the NR radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol extension mechanisms apply.
11.2	Inter-node RRC messages
11.2.1	General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2-, Xn- or the NG-interface, either to or from the gNB, i.e. a single 'logical channel' is used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

HandoverPreparationInformation field descriptions
as-Context
Local RAN context required by the target gNB or DU.
rrm-Config
Local RAN context used mainly for RRM purposes.
sourceConfig
The radio resource configuration as used in the source cell.
ue-CapabilityRAT-List
The UE radio access related capabilities concerning RATs supported by the UE. A gNB that retrieves MRDC related capability containers ensures that the set of included MRDC containers is consistent w.r.t. the feature set related information.
ue-InactiveTime
Duration while UE has not received or transmitted any user data. Thus the timer is still running in case e.g., UE measures the neighbour cells for the HO purpose. Value s1 corresponds to 1 second, s2 corresponds to 2 seconds and so on. Value min1 corresponds to 1 minute, value min1s20 corresponds to 1 minute and 20 seconds, value min1s40 corresponds to 1 minute and 40 seconds and so on. Value hr1 corresponds to 1 hour, hr1min30 corresponds to 1 hour and 30 minutes and so on.

CG-ConfigInfo field descriptions
alignedDRX-Indication
This field is signalled upon MN triggered CGI reporting by the UE that requires aligned DRX configurations between the MCG and the SCG (i.e. same DRX cycle and on-duration configured by MN completely contains on-duration configured by SN).
allowedBC-ListMRDC
A list of indices referring to band combinations in MR-DC capabilities from which SN is allowed to select the SCG band combination. Each entry refers to:
- a band combination numbered according to supportedBandCombinationList and supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch in the UE-MRDC-Capability (in case of (NG)EN-DC), or according to supportedBandCombinationList and supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only in the UE-MRDC-Capability (in case of NE-DC), or according to supportedBandCombinationList in the UE-NR-Capability (in case of NR-DC),
- and the Feature Sets allowed for each band entry. All MR-DC band combinations indicated by this field comprise the MCG band combination, which is a superset of the MCG band(s) selected by MN.
allowedReducedConfigForOverheating
Indicates the reduced configuration that the SCG is allowed to configure.
reducedMaxCCs in allowedReducedConfigForOverheating indicates the maximum number of downlink/uplink PSCell/SCells that the SCG is allowed to configure. This field is used in (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC.
reducedMaxBW-FR1 and reducedMaxBW-FR2 in allowedReducedConfigForOverheating indicates the maximum aggregated bandwidth across all downlink/uplink carriers of FR1 and FR2, respectively that the SCG is allowed to configure. This field is only used in NR-DC.
reducedMaxMIMO-LayersFR1 and reducedMaxMIMO-LayersFR2 in allowedReducedConfigForOverheating indicates the maximum number of downlink/uplink MIMO layers of each serving cell operating on FR1 and FR2, respectively that the SCG is allowed to configure. This field is only used in NR-DC.
candidateCellInfoListMN, candidateCellInfoListSN
Contains information regarding cells that the master node or the source node suggests the target gNB or DU to consider configuring.
For (NG)EN-DC, including CSI-RS measurement results in candidateCellInfoListMN is not supported in this version of the specification. For NR-DC, including SSB and/or CSI-RS measurement results in candidateCellInfoListMN is supported.
candidateCellInfoListMN-EUTRA, candidateCellInfoListSN-EUTRA

11.2.3	Mandatory information in inter-node RRC messages
For the AS-Config transferred within the HandoverPreparationInformation:
-	The source node shall include all fields necessary to reflect the current AS configuration of the UE, except for the fields sourceSCG-NR-Config, sourceSCG-EUTRA-Config and sourceRB-SN-Config, which can be omitted in case the source MN did not receive the latest configuration from the source SN. For RRCReconfiguration included in the field rrcReconfiguration, ReconfigurationWithSync is included with only the mandatory subfields (e.g. newUE-Identity and t304) and ServingCellConfigCommon;
-	Need codes or conditions specified for subfields according to IEs defined in clause 6 do not apply. I.e. some fields shall be included regardless of the "Need" or "Cond" e.g. discardTimer;
-	Based on the received AS configuration, the target node can indicate the delta (difference) to the current AS configuration (as included in HandoverCommand)to the UE. The fields newUE-Identity and t304 included in ReconfigurationWithSync are not used for delta configuration purpose.
The candidateCellInfoListSN(-EUTRA) in CG-Config and the candidateCellInfoListMN(-EUTRA)/candidateCellInfoListSN(-EUTRA) in CG-ConfigInfo need not be included in procedures that do not involve a change of node.
For fields scg-CellGroupConfig, scg-CellGroupConfigEUTRA and scg-RB-Config in CG-Config (sent upon SN initiated SN change or other conditions as specified in field descriptions) and fields mcg-RB-Config, scg-RB-Config and sourceConfigSCG in CG-ConfigInfo (sent upon change of SN):
-	The source node shall include all fields necessary to reflect the current AS configuration of the UE, unless stated otherwise in the field description. For RRCReconfiguration included in the field scg-CellGroupConfig in CG-Config, ReconfigurationWithSync is included with only the mandatory subfields (e.g. newUE-Identity and t304) and ServingCellConfigCommon;
-	Need codes or conditions specified for subfields according to IEs defined in clause 6 do not apply;
-	Based on the received AS configuration, the target node can indicate the delta (difference) as compared to the current AS configuration to the UE. The fields newUE-Identity and t304 in ReconfigurationWithSync are always included by the target node, i.e. they are not used for delta configuration purpose to UE.
For fields in CG-Config and CG-ConfigInfo listed below, absence of the field means that the receiver maintains the values informed via the previous message. Note that every time there is a change in the configuration covered by a listed field, the MN or SN shall include the field and it shall provide the full configuration provided by that field unless stated otherwise. Otherwise, if there is no change, the field can be omitted:

12	Processing delay requirements for RRC procedures
The UE performance requirements for RRC procedures are specified in the following tables. The performance requirement is expressed as the time in [ms] from the end of reception of the network -> UE message on the UE physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for the UE -> network response message with no access delay other than the TTI-alignment (e.g. excluding delays caused by scheduling, the random access procedure or physical layer synchronisation). In case the RRC procedure triggers BWP switching, the RRC procedure delay is the value defined in the following table plus the BWP switching delay defined in TS 38.133 [14], clause 8.6.3.

Annex A (informative):	Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1
A.1	Introduction
The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
A.2	Procedural specification
A.2.1	General principles
The procedural specification provides an overall high level description regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU clause e.g. general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple fields.
Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are sent to the network i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
A.2.2	More detailed aspects
The following more detailed conventions should be used:
-	Bullets:
-	Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are part of the sentence starting with 'The UE shall:'
-	All bullets, including the last one in a sub-clause, should end with a semi-colon i.e. an ';.
-	Conditions:
-	Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in 'if cond1, or cond2.
A.3	PDU specification
A.3.1	General principles
A.3.1.1	ASN.1 sections
The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [6], X.681 [7].
The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in the specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1 code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins with the following:
-	a first text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 start tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "ASN1START" (in all upper case letters);
-	a second text paragraph consisting entirely of a block start tag is included, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "TAG-NAME-START" (in all upper case letters), where the "NAME" refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters).
Similarly, each ASN.1 section ends with the following:
-	a first text paragraph consisting entirely of a blockstop tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "TAG-NAME-STOP" (in all upper-case letters), where the "NAME" refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters);
-	a second text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 stop tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a singlespace and the text "ASN1STOP" (in all upper case letters).
This results in the following tags:
-- ASN1START
-- TAG-NAME-START

-- TAG-NAME-STOP
-- ASN1STOP

The text paragraphs containing either of the start and stop tags should not contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the order they appear, throughout the specification.
NOTE:	A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.
A.3.1.2	ASN.1 identifier naming conventions
The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should be based on the following guidelines:
-	Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without hyphenation. These identifiers, e.g., the RRCConnectionModificationCommand, should be used for reference in the procedure text. Abbreviations should be avoided in these identifiers and abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.
-	Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case, with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a capital, e.g., EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since the "d" in "Selected" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-TimeDifference.
-	Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case thereafter, e.g., establishmentCause. If a field identifier begins with an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is lowercase (plmn-Identity, not pLMN-Identity). The acronym is set off with a hyphen (ue-Identity, not ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers.
-	Identifiers should convey the meaning of the identifier and should avoid adding unnecessary postfixes (e.g. abstractions like 'Info') for the name.
-	Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent possible.
-	Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use 'Meas' instead of 'Measurement' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.
-	For future extension: When an extension is introduced a suffix is added to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/or type. A suffix of the form "‑rX" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/first release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, e.g., Foo-r9 for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type Foo. A suffix of the form "‑rXb" is used for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same release (X) as the original version of the field, "‑rXc" for a second intra-release revision and so on. A suffix of the form "‑vXYZ" is used for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding earlier field or type (see sub-clause A.4), e.g., AnElement-v10b0 for the extension of the ASN.1 type AnElement introduced in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number 0...9, 10, 11, etc. is used to represent the first part of the version number, indicating the release of the protocol. Lower case letters a, b, c, etc. are used to represent the second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than 9. In the procedural specification, in field descriptions as well as in headings suffices are not used, unless there is a clear need to distinguish the extension from the original field.
-	More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the identifiers e.g. MeasObjectUTRA, ConfigCommon. When there is no particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the different variants.
-	It should be avoided to use field identifiers with the same name within the elements of a CHOICE, including using a CHOICE inside a SEQUENCE (to avoid certain compiler errors).

NOTE:	The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.
A.3.1.3	Text references using ASN.1 identifiers
A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the specification is made using the ASN.1 field identifier of the referenced type. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text references should be in the italic font style. The "do not check spelling and grammar" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., "") should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type identifier.
A reference to an RRC PDU should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field identifier followed by the word "message", e.g., a reference to the RRCRelease message.
A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field identifier followed by the word "field", e.g., a reference to the prioritisedBitRate field in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=            SEQUENCE {
    ul-SpecificParameters               SEQUENCE {
        priority                            Priority,
        prioritisedBitRate                  PrioritisedBitRate,
        bucketSizeDuration                  BucketSizeDuration,
        logicalChannelGroup                 INTEGER (0..3)
    }       OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

NOTE:	All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 sections, used as examples in this annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted from the specification.
A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym "IE", e.g., a reference to the IE LogicalChannelConfig in the example above.
References to a specific type of information element should only be used when those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be used in the text reference.
A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the ASN.1 value, e.g., 'if the status field is set to value true'.
A.3.2	High-level message structure
Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types are alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
    message                 DL-DCCH-MessageType
}

DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
    c1                      CHOICE {
        dlInformationTransfer                   DLInformationTransfer,
        handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest     HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
        mobilityFromEUTRACommand                MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
        rrcConnectionReconfiguration            RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
        rrcConnectionRelease                    RRCConnectionRelease,
        securityModeCommand                     SecurityModeCommand,
        ueCapabilityEnquiry                     UECapabilityEnquiry,
        spare1 NULL
    },
    messageClassExtension   SEQUENCE {}
}

-- ASN1STOP

A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU types are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE.
Spare alternatives (i.e., spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).
Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated using the messageClassExtension alternative in the outer level CHOICE.
A.3.3	Message definition
Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::=    SEQUENCE {
    rrc-TransactionIdentifier           RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
    criticalExtensions                  CHOICE {
        c1                                  CHOICE{
            rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8     RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,
            spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
        },
        criticalExtensionsFuture            SEQUENCE {}
    }
}

RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    -- Enter the IEs here.
    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Hooks for critical and non-critical extension should normally be included in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further described in sub-clause A.4.
Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not comprehended by the decoder.
Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., spare3 down to spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE. The number of spare alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the future releases of the protocol.
Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original specifications are used up, is facilitated using the criticalExtensionsFuture in the outer level CHOICE.
In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases of the protocol, the inner level c1 CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be excluded, as shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
    rrc-TransactionIdentifier           RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
    criticalExtensions                  CHOICE {
        rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8
                                            RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,
        criticalExtensionsFuture            SEQUENCE {}
    }
}

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    -- Enter the fields here.
    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.
Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker "...". The original specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at the end of the sequence of information elements contained.
Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING may be facilitated by use of an empty sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::=                   SEQUENCE {
    field1                                  InformationElement1,
    field2                                  InformationElement2,

    nonCriticalExtension                    SEQUENCE {}                     OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a field description table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g. because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that needs to be specified.
%PDU-TypeIdentifier% field descriptions
%field identifier%
Field description.
%field identifier%
Field description.

The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.
The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall include a first paragraph with a field identifier (in bold and italic font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style), e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/or specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of the PDU.
The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be omitted from the field description table.
A.3.4	Information elements
Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-ConfigSIB ::=                 SEQUENCE {
    rootSequenceIndex                   INTEGER (0..1023),
    prach-ConfigInfo                    PRACH-ConfigInfo
}

PRACH-Config ::=                    SEQUENCE {
    rootSequenceIndex                   INTEGER (0..1023),
    prach-ConfigInfo                    PRACH-ConfigInfo                    OPTIONAL    -- Need N
}

PRACH-ConfigInfo ::=                SEQUENCE {
    prach-ConfigIndex                   ENUMERATED {ffs},
    highSpeedFlag                       ENUMERATED {ffs},
    zeroCorrelationZoneConfig           ENUMERATED {ffs}
}

-- ASN1STOP

IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the same set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.
A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in this example, are preferably placed together in a common ASN.1 section. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base, defined as the generic type identifier. It may be complemented by a suffix to distinguish the different variants. The "PRACH-Config" is the generic type identifier in this example, and the "SIB" suffix is added to distinguish the variant. The sub-clause heading and generic references to a group of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type identifier.
The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of an existing IE is created for critical or non-critical extension of the protocol (see sub-clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of the IE is included in the same ASN.1 section defining the original. A suffix is added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in sub-clause A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new version, or extension version, was introduced.
Local IE type definitions, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo in the example above, may be included in the ASN.1 section and be referenced in the other IE types defined in the same ASN.1 section. The use of locally defined IE types should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data elements, to be used in the software implementation.
An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo, should not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 sections in the RRC specification. An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 section should be defined in a separate sub-clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1 section (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in the example above). Such IE types are also referred to as 'global IEs'.
NOTE:	Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the context of another ASN.1 section, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline level of the specification. It should be avoided.
The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the example above, may be followed by a field description table, where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in sub-clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of the field description table is the same as shown in sub-clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type.
A.3.5	Fields with optional presence
A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a value for that field in the encoding:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PreambleInfo ::=                    SEQUENCE {
    numberOfRA-Preambles                INTEGER (1..64)                     DEFAULT 1,
    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted. The omission carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of the field:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-Config ::=                    SEQUENCE {
    rootSequenceIndex                   INTEGER (0..1023),
    prach-ConfigInfo                    PRACH-ConfigInfo                    OPTIONAL    -- Need N
}

-- ASN1STOP

The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted, should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need code. The need code includes the keyword "Need", followed by one of the predefined semantics tags (S, M, N or R) defined in sub-clause 6.1. If the semantics tag S is used, the semantics of the absent field are further specified either in the field description table following the ASN.1 section, or in procedure text.
The addition of OPTIONAL keywords for capability groups is based on the following guideline. If there is more than one field in the lower level IE, then OPTIONAL keyword is added at the group level. If there is only one field in the lower level IE, OPTIONAL keyword is not added at the group level.
A.3.6	Fields with conditional presence
A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the keyword "Cond", followed by a condition tag associated with the field ("UL" in this example):
-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=            SEQUENCE {
    ul-SpecificParameters               SEQUENCE {
        priority                            INTEGER (0),
        ...
    }       OPTIONAL                                                                    -- Cond UL

When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 section, the field description table after the ASN.1 section shall be followed by a conditional presence table. The conditional presence table specifies the conditions for including the fields with conditional presence in the particular ASN.1 section.
Conditional presence
Explanation
UL
Specification of the conditions for including the field associated with the condition tag = "UL". Semantics in case of optional presence under certain conditions may also be specified.

The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading: "Conditional presence") contains the condition tag (in italic font style), which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 section to an entry in the table. The second column (heading: "Explanation") contains a text specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of the field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an optional presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.
Conditional presence should primarily be used when presence of a field depends on the presence and/or value of other fields within the same message. If the presence of a field depends on whether another feature/function has been configured, while this function can be configured independently e.g. by another message and/or at another point in time, the relation is best reflected by means of a statement in the field description table.
If the ASN.1 section does not include any fields with conditional presence, the conditional presence table shall not be included.
Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of conditional presence should be considered.
A.3.7	Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF construct in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE data type, an information element shall be defined for the list elements even if it would not otherwise be needed.
For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as in the following example:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::=           SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityInfo

PLMN-IdentityInfo ::=               SEQUENCE {
    plmn-Identity                       PLMN-Identity,
    cellReservedForOperatorUse          ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP

rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated code to contain types with unpredictable names:
-- /bad example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityList ::=                   SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {
    plmn-Identity                           PLMN-Identity,
    cellReservedForOperatorUse              ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP

A.3.8	Guidelines on use of parameterised SetupRelease type
The usage of the parameterised SetupRelease type is like a function call in programming languages where the element type parameter is passed as a parameter. The parameterised type only implies a textual change in abstract syntax where all references to the parameterised type are replaced by the compiler with the release/setup choice. Two examples of the usage are shown below:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    field-rX               SetupRelease { IE-rX }                   OPTIONAL,      --  Need M
    ...
}


RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    field-rX               SetupRelease { Element-rX }
}                                                                   OPTIONAL,       -- Need M

Element-rX ::= SEQUENCE {
    field1-rX                  IE1-rX,
    field2-rX                  IE2-rX                               OPTIONAL        -- Need N
}                                                                       OPTIONAL,   -- Need M

-- /example/ ASN1STOP

The SetupRelease is always be used with only named IEs, i.e. the example below is not allowed:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    field-rX       SetupRelease { SEQUENCE {   -- Unnamed SEQUENCEs are not allowed!
            field1-rX                  IE1-rX,
            field2-rX                  IE2-rX                         OPTIONAL        -- Need N
        }
    }                                                                     OPTIONAL,   -- Need M
}

-- /example/ ASN1STOP

If a field defined using the parameterized SetupRelease type requires procedural text, the field is referred to using the values defined for the type itself, namely, "setup" and "release". For example, procedural text for field-rX above could be as follows:
1> if field-rX is set to "setup":
2> do something;
1> else (field-rX is set to "release"):
2> release field-rX (if appropriate).
A.3.9	Guidelines on use of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList
In order to benefit from delta signalling when modifying lists with many and/or large elements, so-called add/mod- and release- lists should be used. Instead of a single list containing all elements of the list, the ASN.1 provides two lists. One list is used to convey the actual elements that are to be added to the list or modified in the list. The second list conveys only the identities (IDs) of the list elements that are to be released from the list. In other words, the ASN.1 defines only means to signal modifications to a list maintained in the receiver (typically the UE). An example is provided below:
-- /example/ ASN1START

AnExampleIE ::=         SEQUENCE {
    elementsToAddModList    SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element                                     OPTIONAL,   --  Need N
    elementsToReleaseList   SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF ElementId                                   OPTIONAL,   --  Need N
    ...
}

Element ::=             SEQUENCE {
    elementId               ElementId,
    aField                  INTEG ER (0..16777215),
    anotherField            OCTET STRING,
    ...
}

ElementId ::=           INTEGER (0..maxNrofElements-1)

maxNrofElements         INTEGER ::= 50
maxNrofElements-1       INTEGER ::= 49

-- /example/ ASN1STOP

As can be seen, the elements of the list must contain an identity (INTEGER) that identifies the elements unambiguously upon addition, modification and removal. It is recommended to define an IE for that identifier (here ElementId) so that it can be used both for a field inside the element as well as in the elementsToReleaseList.
Both lists should be made OPTIONAL and flagged as "Need N". The need code reflects that the UE does not maintain the received lists as such but rather updates its configuration using the information therein. In other words, it is not possible to provide via delta signalling an update to a previously signalled elementsToAddModList or elementsToReleaseList (which Need M would imply). The update is always in relation to the UE's internal configuration.
Note that the release of a field (a list element as well as any other field) releases all its sub-fields (sub-fields configured by elementsToAddModList and any other sub-field).
If no procedural text is provided for a set of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList, the following generic procedure applies:
The UE shall:
1>	for each ElementId in the elementsToReleaseList,:
2>	if the current UE configuration includes an Element with the given ElementId:
3>	release the Element from the current UE configuration;
1>	for each Element in the elementsToAddModList:
2>	if the current UE configuration includes an Element with the given ElementId:
3>	modify the configured Element in accordance with the received Element;
2>	else:
3>	add received Element to the UE configuration.
A.3.10	Guidelines on use of of lists (without ToAddModList and ToReleaseList)
As per subclause 6.1.3, when using lists without the ToAddModList and ToReleaseList structure, the contents of the lists are always replaced. To illustrate this, an example is provided below:
-- /example/ ASN1START
-- TAG_EXAMPLE_LISTS_START

AnExampleIE ::=         SEQUENCE {
    elementList             SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element                                     OPTIONAL,   --  Need M
    ...,
    [[
    elementListExt-v2030    SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElementsExt)) OF Element                                  OPTIONAL,   --  Need M
    ]]
}

Element ::=         SEQUENCE {
    useFeatureX         BOOLEAN,
    aField              INTEGER (0..127)                                                                        OPTIONAL,   --  Need M
    anotherField        INTEGER (0..127)                                                                        OPTIONAL,   --  Need R
    ...
}

maxNrofElements         INTEGER ::= 8
maxNrofElements-1       INTEGER ::= 7
maxNrofElementsExt      INTEGER ::= 8
maxNrofElementsExt-1    INTEGER ::= 7

-- TAG_EXAMPLE_LISTS_STOP
-- /example/ ASN1STOP

As can be seen, the elementList list itself uses Need M, but each list entry Element contains mandatory, Need M and Need R fields. If the list is first signalled to UE with 3 entries, and subsequently again with 2 entries, UE shall retain only the latter list, i.e. the list with 2 elements will completely replace the list with 3 elements. That also means that the field aField will be treated as if it was newly created, i.e. network must include it if it wishes UE to utilize the field even if it was previously signalled. This also implies that the Need M field (aField) will be treated in the same way as the Need R field (anotherField), i.e. delta signalling is not applied and the network has to signal the field to ensure UE does not release the value (which is why Need M should not normally be used in the entries of these lists).
A.4	Extension of the PDU specifications
A.4.1	General principles to ensure compatibility
It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on different versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In particular, this requirement applies for the following kind of protocol extensions:
-	Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected behaviour or damage).
-	Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it should be possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the handling of the other parts of the message).
-	Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If used, the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.
It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring of extensions may not be required.
The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for introducing protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is used merely when there is a need to introduce a 'clean' message version. Such a need appears when the last message version includes a large number of non-critical extensions, which results in issues like readability, overhead associated with the extension markers. The critical extension mechanism may also be considered when it is complicated to accommodate the extensions by means of non-critical extension mechanisms.
A.4.2	Critical extension of messages and fields
The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There are both "outer branch" and "inner branch" mechanisms available. The "outer branch" consists of a CHOICE having the name criticalExtensions, with two values, c1 and criticalExtensionsFuture. The criticalExtensionsFuture branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the "inner branch" mechanism.
The "inner branch" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form "MessageName-rX-IEs" (e.g., "RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs") or "spareX", with the spare values having type NULL. The "-rX-IEs" structures contain the complete structure of the message IEs for the appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10 version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional Rel-10 fields.
The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an 'outer branch', or an 'outer branch' in combination with an 'inner branch' including a certain number of spares:
-	For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.
-	An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.
-	The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values). The estimation of the critical extension likelihood may be based on the number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.
-	In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions are added using the outer branch.
The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release
-- /example/ ASN1START                  -- Original release

RRCMessage ::=                          SEQUENCE {

    criticalExtensions                      CHOICE {
        c1                                      CHOICE{
            rrcMessage-r8                           RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
            spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL

            criticalExtensionsFuture                SEQUENCE {}
        }
    }
}

-- ASN1STOP

It is important to note that critical extensions may also be used at the level of individual fields i.e. a field may be replaced by a critically extended version. When sending the extended version, the original version may also be included (e.g. original field is mandatory, E-UTRAN is unaware if UE supports the extended version). In such cases, a UE supporting both versions may be required to ignore the original field. The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release.
-- /example/ ASN1START                  -- Original release

RRCMessage ::=                          SEQUENCE {
    rrc-TransactionIdentifier               RRC-TransactionIdentifier,

            rrcMessage-r8                           RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
            spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL

    field2-rN                           InformationElement2-rN                  OPTIONAL,   -- Need N

    nonCriticalExtension                      SEQUENCE {}                       OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

Conditional presence
Explanation
NoField2rN
The field is optionally present, need N, if field2-rN is absent. Otherwise the field is absent

Finally, it is noted that a critical extension may be introduced in the same release as the one in which the original field was introduced e.g. to correct an essential ASN.1 error. In such cases a UE capability may be introduced, to assist the network in deciding whether or not to use the critical extension.
In the case of list fields (SEQUENCE OF types in ASN.1) using the ToAddMod/ToRelease construction, the use of critical extensions to increase the size of a list should be avoided; that is, replacing the original list field by a new field also used to signal entries previously covered by the original field (i.e. extensions done according to the following example) should be avoided:
-- /example/ ASN1START                  -- Discouraged example

ContainingStructure ::=                 SEQUENCE {
    listElementToAddModList                 SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElement         OPTIONAL,    -- Need N
    ...,
    [[
    listElementToAddModList-rN              SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements-rN)) OF ListElement      OPTIONAL     -- Need N
    ]]
}-- ASN1STOP

Instead, a non-critical list extension mechanism should typically be used, such that the extension field only adds the new entries of the list.  This approach is further described in subclause A.4.3.6.
If the critical extension mechanism for a list is used, it should be clarified in the field description that the two versions of the list are not configured together, and that the network should release the contents of the original version when configuring the replacement version.
A.4.3	Non-critical extension of messages
A.4.3.1	General principles
The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional guidelines apply:
-	When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has been critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in earlier critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.
-	The extension marker ("...") is the primary non-critical extension mechanism that is used but empty sequences may be used if length determinant is not required. Examples of cases where a length determinant is not required:
-	at the end of a message;
-	at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
-	When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned parameter belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as the 'default extension location').
-	It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version of the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest possible level.
-	In specific cases it may be preferable to place extensions elsewhere (referred to as the 'actual extension location') e.g. when it is possible to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group should be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message.
-	In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following higher level in the message should be considered.
-	In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an IE should be defined. The IE's ASN.1 definition should be placed in the same ASN.1 section as the default extension location. In case there are intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension location, an IE may be defined for each level. Intermediate levels are primarily introduced for readability and overview. Hence intermediate levels need not always be introduced e.g. they may not be needed when the default and the actual extension location are within the same ASN.1 section.
A.4.3.2	Further guidelines
Further to the general principles defined in the previous section, the following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension markers:
-	Extension markers within SEQUENCE:
-	Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the higher nesting levels.
-	Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields as well as for information elements whose extension would result in complex structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list).
-	Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT.
-	Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages on BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully.
-	The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the specification are grouped together using double brackets.
-	Extension markers within ENUMERATED:
-	Spare values may be used until the number of values reaches the next power of 2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit, given that the use of spare values in a later Release is possible without any error cases.
-	A suffix of the form "vXYZ" is used for the identifier of each new value, e.g. "value-vXYZ".
-	Extension markers within CHOICE:
-	Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g. ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is not required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports the extended value.
-	A suffix of the form "vXYZ" is used for the identifier of each new choice value, e.g. "choice-vXYZ".
Non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an OCTET or BIT STRING:
-	When a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a "Need" code should not be provided for the field, which always is a group including at least one extension and a field facilitating further possible extensions. For simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a "Need" code when the field is not actually used either.
Further, more general, guidelines:
-	In case a need code is not provided for a group, a "Need" code is provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e. including for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to clarify the action upon absence of the whole group.
A.4.3.3	Typical example of evolution of IE with local extensions
The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a number of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension mechanism is used.
NOTE	In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n while the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the release n receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more advanced mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.

Some remarks regarding the extensions of InformationElement1 as shown in the above example:
–	The InformationElement1 is initially extended with a number of non-critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of the IE InformationElement1 (i.e. InformationElement1-r10) is defined in which the earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the original field.
–	The value4-v880 is replacing a spare value defined in the original protocol version for field1. Likewise value6-v1170 replaces spare3 that was originally defined in the r10 version of field1.
–	Within the critically extended release 10 version of InformationElement1, the names of the original fields/IEs are not changed, unless there is a real need to distinguish them from other fields/IEs. E.g. the field1 and InformationElement4 were defined in the original protocol version (release 8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the field3-r9 is introduced in release 9 and not re-tagged; although, the InformationElement3 is also critically extended and therefore tagged InformationElement3-r10 in the release 10 version of InformationElement1.
A.4.3.4	Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a message
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
–	The InformationElement4 is introduced in the original version of the protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.
A.4.3.5	Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default extension location
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case an extension is not placed at the default extension location.
–	ParentIE-WithEM
The IE ParentIE-WithEMis an example of a high level IE including the extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM and ChildIE2-WithoutEM which not include the extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.
The example illustrates how the two extension IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 and ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 (both in release N) are used to connect non-critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs to the actual extension location in this IE.

}

-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
–	The fields childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0 may not really need to be optional (depends on what is defined at the next lower level).
–	In general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.
–	ChildIE1-WithoutEM
The IE ChildIE1-WithoutEM is an example of a lower level IE, used to control certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be setup or released using the local IE ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature. The example illustrates how the new field chIE1-NewField is added in release N to the configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the following assumptions:
–	When initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.
–	When the configurable feature is released, the new field should be released also.
–	When omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).
–	When omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).
The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.

A.4.3.6	Non-critical extensions of lists with ToAddMod/ToRelease
When the size of a list using the ToAddMod/ToRelease construction is extended and/or fields are added to the list element structure, the list should be non-critically extended in accordance with the following general principles:
–	When only the size of the list is extended, this extension is reflected in a non-critical extension of the list, with a "SizeExt" suffix added to the end of the field name (before the -vNxy suffix). The differential size of the extended list uses the suffix "Diff". A new ToRelease list is needed, and its range should include only the increase in list size. In many cases, extending the list size will also require an extended list element ID type to account for the increased size of the list; in these cases the element type will need to be extended to include the extended element ID, resulting in a more complex extension (see example 3 for further discussion of this case). The field description table should indicate that the UE considers the original list and the extension list as a single list; thus entries added with the original list can be modified by the extension list (or removed by the extension of the ToRelease list), or vice versa. The result is as shown in the following example:

-- /example 1/ ASN1START

ContainingStructure ::=             SEQUENCE {
    listElementToAddModList              SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElement             OPTIONAL,    -- Need N
    listElementToReleaseList             SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElementId           OPTIONAL,    -- Need N
    ...,
    [[
    -- Non-critical extension lists
    listElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNxy	 SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElement      OPTIONAL,    -- Need N
    listElementToReleaseListSizeExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElementId    OPTIONAL     -- Need N
    ]]
}
-- ASN1STOP

–	When fields are added to the list element structure, an extension marker should normally be used if available. If no extension marker is available or if overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an extension structure should be created for the new fields, with the suffix "Ext" added to the end of the field name and the element structure type name (before the -vNxy suffix), and a parallel ToAddMod list introduced to hold the new structures, also with the "Ext" suffix. The field description table should indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries, and in the same order, as the original list. No new ToRelease list is typically needed (unless the list element ID type changes). It should typically be ensured that the contained fields in the "Ext" elements are releasable without release and add of the entire list element; this can, for instance, be ensured by having the new fields be OPTIONAL Need R. If multiple extensions of the same list are needed, the version suffix should distinguish the lists (e.g. listElementToAddModListExt-vNwz added after listElementToAddModListExt-vNxy). The result is as shown in the following example:
-- /example 2/ ASN1START

ContainingStructure ::=             SEQUENCE {
    listElementToAddModList             SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElement             OPTIONAL,    -- Need N

}

ListElementExt-vNwz ::=				 SEQUENCE {
    field4-rN                            INTEGER (0..255)                                                   OPTIONAL     -- Need R

-- ASN1STOP

–	When the size of a list is extended and fields are added to the list element structure, an extension marker should normally be used for the added fields if available, and the list extended with the non-critical mechanism as described in example 1 above. Note that if the list element ID type changes in this case, the new ID can be added after the extension marker, and the entries of the size-extended ToRelease list should have the type of the new ID (e.g. ListElementId-vNxy). If no extension marker is available or if overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an extension structure should be created for the new fields and a parallel list with ToAddMod introduced to hold the extension structures, as in the second example above, for entries of the original list and for entries of the extension list holding new entries. The field description table should indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries, and in the same order, as the concatenation of the original list and the extension list. An extended ToRelease list is needed, but no additional parallel ToRelease list is needed (i.e. there is no listElementToReleaseListExt-vNxy in the example below), as the original and extended ToRelease lists suffice to release any element of the combined list. The extended element ID type should be captured as a non-critical extension of the original element ID type, with the field description indicating that if the extended ID is present, the original ID is ignored. The result is as shown in the following example:
-- /example 3/ ASN1START

–	When different extensions are made to a list in separate releases, the extension mechanisms described above may interact. In case fields are added in Rel-M (listElementToAddModListExt-vMxy) and later the list size is extended in Rel-N (listElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNwz), the size-extended list in Rel-N should be a single list extending the combination of listElementToAddModList and listElementToAddModListExt-vMxy.

A.5	Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC messages
The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a Transaction identifier
1:	DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-Idle should not include the RRC transaction identifier.
2:	All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC transaction identifier.
3:	All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4:	All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an RRC transaction identifier.
5:	All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction identifier.
A.6	Guidelines regarding use of need codes
The following rule provides guidance for determining need codes for optional downlink fields:
- if the field needs to be stored by the UE (i.e. maintained) when absent:
- use Need M (=Maintain);
- else, if the field needs to be released by the UE when absent:
- use Need R (=Release);
- else, if UE shall take no action when the field is absent (i.e. UE does not even need to maintain any existing value of the field):
- use Need N (=None);
- else (UE behaviour upon absence does not fit any of the above conditions):
- use Need S (=Specified);
- specify the UE behaviour upon absence of the field in the procedural text or in the field description table.
A.7	Guidelines regarding use of conditions
Conditions are primarily used to specify network restrictions, for which the following types can be distinguished:
-	Message Contents related constraints e.g. that a field B is mandatory present if the same message includes field A and when it is set value X.
-	Configuration Constraints e.g. that a field D can only be signalled if field C is configured and set to value Y. (i.e. regardless of whether field C is present in the same message or previously configured).
The use of these conditions is illustrated by an example.

A.8	Miscellaneous
The following miscellaneous convention should be used:
-	UE capabilities: TS 38.306 [26] specifies that the network should in general respect the UE's capabilities. Hence there is no need to include statement clarifying that the network, when setting the value of a certain configuration field, shall respect the related UE capabilities unless there is a particular need e.g. particularly complicated cases.
Annex B (informative):	RRC Information
B.1	Protection of RRC messages
The following list provides information which messages can be sent (unprotected) prior to AS security activation and which messages can be sent unprotected after AS security activation.

B.2	Description of BWP configuration options
There are two possible ways to configure BWP#0 (i.e. the initial BWP) for a UE:
1)	Configure BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon, but do not configure dedicated configurations in BWP-DownlinkDedicated or BWP-UplinkDedicated in ServingCellConfig.
2)	Configure both BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon and configure dedicated configurations in at least one of BWP-DownlinkDedicated or BWP-UplinkDedicated in ServingCellConfig.
The same way of configuration is used for UL BWP#0 and DL BWP#0 if both are configured.
With the first option (illustrated by figure B2-1 below), the BWP#0 is not considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP can still be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this configuration. The BWP#0 can still be used even if it does not have the dedicated configuration, albeit in a more limited manner since only the SIB1-defined configurations are available. For example, only DCI format 1_0 can be used with BWP#0 without dedicated configuration, so changing to another BWP requires RRCReconfiguration since DCI format 1_0 doesn't support DCI-based switching.

Figure B2-1: BWP#0 configuration without dedicated configuration
With the second option (illustrated by figure B2-2 below), the BWP#0 is considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP cannot be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this configuration. However, UE supporting more than one BWP can still switch to and from BWP#0 e.g. via DCI normally, and there are no explicit limitations to using the BWP#0 (compared to the first option).

Figure B2-2: BWP#0 configuration with dedicated configuration
For BWP#0, the BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon should match the parameters configured by MIB and SIB1 (if provided) in the corresponding serving cell.

Annex D (normative):	UE requirements on ASN.1 comprehension
This clause specifies UE requirements regarding the ASN.1 transfer syntax support, i.e. the ASN.1 definitions to be comprehended by the UE.
A UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease shall comprehend the entire transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X, in particular at least the first version upon ASN.1 freeze. The UE is however not required to support dedicated signalling related transfer syntax associated with optional features it does not support.
In case a UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease supports a feature specified in release Y, which is later than release X, (i.e. early UE implementation) additional requirements apply. The UE obviously also has to support the ASN.1 parts related to indicating support of the feature (in UE capabilities).
Critical extensions (dedicated signaling)
If the early implemented feature involves one or more critical extensions in dedicated signalling, the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release Y that are related to the feature implemented early. This, in particular, concerns the ASN.1 parts related to configuration of the feature.
If configuration of an early implemented feature introduced in release Y involves a message or field that has been critically extended, the UE shall support configuration of all features supported by the UE that are associated with sub-fields of this critical extension. Apart from the early implemented feature(s), the UE needs, however, not to support functionality beyond what is defined in the release the UE indicates in access stratum release.
Let's consider the example of a UE indicating value X in field accessStratumRelease that supports the features A1, A3, and A5, associated with fields fieldA1, fieldA3 and fieldA5 of InformationElementA (see ASN.1 below).
The feature A5 implemented early is associated with fieldA5, and can only be configured by the –rY version of InformationElementA. In such case, the UE should support configuration of all the features A1, A3 and A5 associated with fields fieldA1, fieldA3 and fieldA5 by the –rY version of InformationElementA.
If, however, one of the features was modified, e.g. the feature A3 associated with fieldA3, the network should assume the UE only supports the feature A3 according to the release it indicated in field accessStratumRelease (i.e. X).
The UE is neither required to support the additional code-point (n80-vY0) nor the additional sub-field (fieldA3c-rY).
InformationElementA-rX ::=      SEQUENCE {
	fieldA1-rX                      InformationElementA1-rX                 OPTIONAL,   -- Need N

    fieldA5-rY                      InformationElementA5-rY                 OPTIONAL    -- Need R
}

InformationElementA3-rX ::= SEQUENCE {
    fieldA3a-rX                     InformationElementA3a-rX                OPTIONAL,   -- Need N
    fieldA3b-rX                     ENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40}              OPTIONAL    -- Need R
}

InformationElementA3-rY ::=    SEQUENCE {
    fieldA3a-rY                     InformationElementA3a-rX                OPTIONAL,   -- Need N
    fieldA3b-rY                     ENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40, n80-vY0}     OPTIONAL,   -- Need R
    fieldA3c-rY                     InformationElementA3c-rY                OPTIONAL    -- Need R
}

Non-critical extensions (dedicated and broadcast signaling)
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions, the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release Y that are related to the feature implemented early.
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions in dedicated signaling, the network does not include extensions introduced after the release X that are not the parts related to the feature which the UE indicates early support of in UE capabilities. The UE shall anyway comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) which indicate absence of such extensions.
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions in system information, the SIB(s) containing the release Y fields related to the early implemented features may also include other extensions introduced after the release X that are not the parts related to the feature which the UE supports. The UE shall comprehend such intermediate fields (but again is not required to support the functionality associated with these intermediate fields, in case this concerns optional features not supported by the UE).
