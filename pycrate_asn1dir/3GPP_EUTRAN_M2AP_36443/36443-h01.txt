3	Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
Elementary Procedure: M2AP consists of Elementary Procedures (Eps). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between eNBs and the MCE. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some Eps is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the Eps may be invoked independently of each other as standalone procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of several M2AP Eps together or together with Eps from other interfaces is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g. TS 36.300 [3] and TS 23.246 [8]).
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of Eps are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 Eps, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
-	On time supervision expiry (i.e. absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
-	One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined for successful outcome.
Class 2 Eps are considered always successful.
eNB MBMS M2AP ID: Unique identity, referencing the MBMS-service-associated logical M2-connection within an eNB.
MCE MBMS M2AP ID: Unique identity, referencing the MBMS-service-associated logical M2-connection within an MCE.
MBMS E-RAB: denotes both, the data bearer established between the eNB and the UE(s) to transport MBMS data and the MBMS M1 data bearer.
MBMS-service-associated signalling: When M2AP messages associated to one MBMS service uses the MBMS-service-associated logical M2-connection for association of the message to the respective MBMS service in eNB and EPC.
MBMS-service-associated logical M2-connection: The MBMS-service-associated logical M2-connection uses the identities eNB MBMS M2AP ID and MCE MBMS M2AP ID. For a received M2AP message the MCE identifies the associated MBMS E-RAB based on the MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE and the eNB identifies the associated MBMS-RAB based on the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE.

3.2	Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
MCCH	Multicast Control Channel 
PMCH	Physical Multicast Channel 
SC-PTM	Single Cell Point to Multipoint
4	General
4.1	Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which “shall” be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node “shall” perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which “shall, if supported” be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node “shall, if supported,” perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see section 10 in TS 36.413 [4].
4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by mechanism where all current and future messages, and Ies or groups of related Ies, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word “procedure”, e.g. E-RAB procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word “message”, e.g. MESSAGE NAME message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation “IE”, e.g. Information Element IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the “Value” is written as it is specified in subclause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. “Value”.
5	M2AP Services
The present clause describes the services an eNB offers to its associated MCE.
5.1	M2AP procedure modules
The M2 interface M2AP procedures may be sub-divided as follows:
1.	M2AP MBMS session control procedures;
2.	M2AP global procedures;
The M2AP session control procedures are related to MBMS services.
The Global Procedures module contains procedures that are not related to a specific MBMS service.
5.2	Parallel transactions
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any instance in time one protocol peer shall have a maximum of one ongoing M2AP procedure related to a certain MBMS service.
6	Services Expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of M2AP messages. M2AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
7	Functions of M2AP
The M2AP protocol provides the following functions:
-	MBMS Session Handling. This function supports start, stop and modify of an MBMS session, as well as configuration and modification of basic radio transmission parameters related to that service.
-	MBMS Scheduling Information. This function provides MCCH related information, and optional session suspension decision to the eNB.
-	Reporting of General Error Situations. This function allows reporting of general error situations, for which function specific error messages have not been defined.
-	Resetting the M2. This function is used to reset the M2 interface. 
-	Setting up the M2. This function is used to exchange necessary data for the eNB for setup the M2 interface, provides basic configuration of radio parameters for transmission of MBMS data and implicitly perform an M2 Reset.
-	eNB and MCE Configuration Update functions are to update configuration data exchanged during setup of M2.
-	MBMS Service Counting. This function enables the MCE to perform counting and to receive the counting results for the MBMS service(s) per MBSFN area.
-	MBMS Overload Notification. This function enables the eNB to notify the MCE about the MBMS overload status.
The mapping between the above functions and M2 Eps is shown in the table below.

The following applies concerning interference between Elementary Procedures:
-	The Reset procedure takes precedence over all other Eps.
8.2	MBMS Session Start
8.2.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Start procedure is to request the eNB to notify Ues about an upcoming MBMS Session of a given MBMS Bearer Service and to establish an MBMS E-RAB and an MBMS-service-associated logical M2-connection. The MBMS Session Start procedure is triggered by the MCE.
The procedure uses MBMS-Service-associated signalling.
8.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2-1. MBMS Session Start procedure. Successful operation.
The MCE initiates the procedure by sending an MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message. If the eNB accepts the MBMS session start request, the eNB responds with the MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message. The eNB shall select and join the IP multicast (identified by the IP multicast address and the IP address of the multicast source as described by the TNL Information IE or, if present, the Alternative TNL Information IE) to enable the reception of MBMS data.
If the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message contains the MBMS Session Identity IE, the eNB shall use it for broadcast of the MBMS Session Identity on the air interface.
If the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message contains the SC-PTM information IE, the eNB shall use SC-PTM for the related MBMS service in the relevant cells. The eNB shall establish or modify the resources according to the values of the Allocation and Retention Priority IE (priority level and pre-emption indicators) and the resource situation as follows:
-	The eNB shall consider the priority level of the requested session, when deciding on the resource allocation.
-	The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (individually or in combination) be used to determine whether the session has to be started unconditionally and immediately. If the requested session is marked as “may trigger pre-emption” and the resource situation requires so, the eNB may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced release of a lower priority session which is marked as “pre-emptable”. Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption procedure is operator-dependent, the pre-emption indicators shall be treated as follows:
1.	If the Pre-emption Capability IE is set to “may trigger pre-emption”, then this allocation request is allowed to trigger a pre-emption procedure.
2.	If the Pre-emption Capability IE is set to “shall not trigger pre-emption”, then this allocation request is not allowed to trigger a pre-emption procedure.
3.	If the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE is set to “pre-emptable”, then this session shall be included in the pre-emption process.
4.	If the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE is set to “not pre-emptable”, then this session shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
5.	If the Priority Level IE is set to “no priority” the given values for the Pre-emption Capability IE and Pre-emption Vulnerability IE shall not be considered. Instead the values “shall not trigger pre-emption” and “not pre-emptable” shall prevail.
-	The E-UTRAN pre-emption process shall keep the following rule: E-UTRAN shall only pre-empt sessions with lower priority, in ascending order of priority.
The eNB shall report to the MCE, in the MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message the result of the requested MBMS E-RAB.
8.2.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.2.3-1. MBMS Session Start procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the eNB is not capable of correctly processing the request (e.g. the MBMS resources could not be established at all in any cell), the MCE shall be informed by the MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message.
8.2.4	Abnormal Conditions
In case the SC-PTM information IE is received, but does not contain any cell of the eNB, the MCE shall be informed by the MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message.
8.3	MBMS Session Stop
8.3.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Stop procedure is to release the corresponding MBMS E-RAB and the MBMS-service-associated logical M2-connection. The MBMS Session Stop procedure is triggered by the MCE.
The procedure uses MBMS-Service-associated signalling.
8.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.2-1. MBMS Session Stop procedure. Successful operation.
The MCE initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message. Upon receipt of the MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message, the eNB shall respond with the MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE message. The eNB shall disable the reception from the IP backbone of the particular MBMS bearer service, release the affected resources and remove the MBMS bearer context.
8.3.3	Abnormal Conditions
Void.
8.4	MBMS Scheduling Information
8.4.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Scheduling Information Procedure is to provide MCCH related information, and optional session suspension decision to the eNB.
The procedure uses non MBMS-Service-associated signalling.
8.4.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.2-1. MBMS Scheduling Information procedure. Successful operation.
The MCE initiates the procedure by sending the MBMS SCHEDULING INFORMATION message to the eNB. The eNB shall store the MBSFN Area Configuration Item IE, apply the MCCH update from the modification period defined in the MCCH Update Time IE, and transmit the MCCH according to the MCCH configuration for the given MBSFN area indicated by the MCE. If an empty PMCH Configuration List IE is contained in this message for an MBSFN area, the eNB shall update the content of the corresponding MCCH so as not to include PMCH related information over the corresponding MCCH. If the Modulation and Coding Scheme 2 IE is included, the eNB shall ignore the Modulation and Coding Scheme IE and use the Modulation and Coding Scheme 2 IE instead. If the received PMCH Configuration IE contains the MCH Scheduling Period Extended IE, the eNB shall take its value into account instead of the value signalled in the MCH Scheduling Period IE. If the received PMCH Configuration IE contains the MCH Scheduling Period Extended 2 IE, the eNB shall take its value into account instead of the value signalled in the MCH Scheduling Period IE. The eNB shall schedule the MBMS services in the MCCH according to the order defined in the MBMS Session List per PMCH IE. If the MBMS Suspension Notification List IE is included in this message for an MBSFN area, the eNB shall broadcast the suspension decision over the air interface from the radio frame defined by the SFN IE, until the end of the Modification Period just before the "MCCH Update Time".
If the MBMS SCHEDULING INFORMATION message contains the Subframe Allocation Extended IE included in the MBSFN Subframe Configuration IE, the eNB shall, if supported, store it and take it into account.
8.4.3	Abnormal Conditions
Void.
8.5	Reset
8.5.1	General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the eNB or part of eNB M2AP MBMS-service-related contexts, in the event of a failure in the MCE or vice versa. This procedure does not affect the application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the M2 Setup procedure.
The procedure uses non MBMS-service-associated signalling.
8.5.2	Successful Operation
8.5.2.1	Reset Procedure Initiated from the MCE

Figure 8.5.2.1-1. Reset procedure initiated from the MCE. Successful operation.
In the event of a failure at the MCE, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the eNB.
At reception of RESET message the eNB shall release all allocated resources on M2 and M1/Uu related to MBMS-service association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the indicated MBMS-service contexts including MBMS M2AP IDs.
After the eNB has released all assigned M2 and M1 resources and MBMS-service contexts for all indicated MBMS-service association(s), the eNB shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The eNB does not need to wait for the release of radio resources to be completed before returning the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. 
If the RESET message contains the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection list IE, then:
-	The eNB shall use the MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE and/or the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE to explicitly identify the MBMS service association(s) to be reset.
-	The eNB shall in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message include, for each MBMS service association to be reset, the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection list IE. The MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item Ies shall be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connections. Empty MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item Ies, received in the RESET message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE is included in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE for an MBMS service association, the eNB shall include the MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE in the corresponding MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE is included in an MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE for an MBMS service association, the eNB shall include the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE in the corresponding MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
Interactions with other procedures:
If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except another Reset procedure) on the same M2 interface related to a MBMS service association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be aborted.
8.5.2.2	Reset Procedure Initiated from the eNB

Figure 8.5.2.2-1. Reset procedure initiated from the eNB. Successful operation.
In the event of a failure at the eNB, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the MCE.
At reception of RESET message the MCE shall release all allocated resources on M2 related to MBMS-service association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and the indicated MBMS-service contexts on M2 for the eNB.
After the MCE has released all assigned M2 resources and MBMS-service contexts for all the eNB indicated MBMS-service association(s), the MCE shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
If the RESET message contains the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection list IE, then:
-	The MCE shall use the MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE and/or the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE to explicitly identify the MBMS service association(s) to be reset.
-	The MCE shall in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message include, for each MBMS service association to be reset, the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection list IE. The MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item Ies shall be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connections. Empty MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item Ies, received in the RESET message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE is included in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE for an MBMS service association, the MCE shall include the MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE in the corresponding MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE is included in an MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE for an MBMS service association, the MCE shall include the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE in the corresponding MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
Interactions with other procedures:
If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except another Reset procedure) on same M2 interface related to a MBMS service association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be aborted.
8.5.3	Abnormal Conditions
8.5.3.1 	Abnormal Condition at the MCE 
If the RESET message includes the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection list IE, but neither the MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE nor the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE is present for a MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE, then the MCE shall ignore the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE. The MCE may return the empty MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection list IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. 
8.5.3.2 	Abnormal Condition at the eNB 
If the RESET message includes the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection list IE, but neither the MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE nor the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE is present for a MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE, then the eNB shall ignore the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE. The eNB may return the empty MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection Item IE in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M2-connection list IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. 
8.5.3.3 	Crossing of Reset Messages 
If Reset procedure is ongoing in eNB and the eNB receives a RESET message from the peer entity on the same M2 interface related to one or several MBMS service associations previously requested to be reset, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the received RESET message, the eNB shall respond with RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.5.2.1.
If Reset procedure is ongoing in MCE and the MCE receives a RESET message from the peer entity on the same M2 interface related to one or several MBMS service associations previously requested to be reset, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the received RESET message, the MCE shall respond with RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.5.2.2.
8.6	M2 Setup
8.6.1	General
The purpose of the M2 Setup procedure is to exchange application level data needed for the eNB and MCE to interoperate correctly on the M2 interface and to configure MCCH related content on the BCCH for each of the cells controlled by the eNB which is foreseen to participate in MBMS service data transmission. This procedure shall be the first M2AP procedure triggered after the TNL association has become operational. The procedure uses non MBMS-service-associated signalling.
This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data in the eNB and the MCE and MCCH related BCCH data in all cells served by the eNB. This procedure also re-initialises the E-UTRAN M2AP MBMS service related contexts (if any) and erases all related signalling connections in the two nodes like a Reset procedure would do.
8.6.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.6.2-1. M2 Setup procedure. Successful operation.
The eNB initiates the procedure by sending a M2 SETUP REQUEST message including the appropriate data to the MCE. The eNB shall include in the M2 SETUP REQUEST message the cell(s) which is (are) foreseen to participate in MBMS service data transmission.
The MCE responds with M2 SETUP RESPONSE message including the appropriate data. The MCE shall provide the MCCH related BCCH configuration (and, if required, the MCCH related BCCH extended configuration) for all cells indicated in the M2 SETUP REQUEST message.
The exchanged data shall be stored in the respective node, MCCH related BCCH configuration broadcasted as provided by the MCE in the respective cell(s), and used for the duration of the TNL association or until any further configuration update procedure is performed.
When this procedure is finished the M2 interface is operational, all affected cells are ready for MBMS service data transmission and other M2 messages can be exchanged.
If the M2 SETUP REQUEST message contains the eNB Name IE the MCE may use this IE as a human readable name of the eNB.
If the M2 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the MCE Name IE the eNB may use this IE as a human readable name of the MCE.
The eNB shall broadcast the MCCH related BCCH configuration only in those cells indicated in the Cell Information List IE contained in the M2 SETUP RESPONSE message for which the Cell Reservation Info IE within the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE is not set to “reserved Cell”.
If the M2 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the Modification Period Extended IE within the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE, the eNB shall take its value into account instead of the value signalled in the Modification Period IE.
If the M2 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the Repetition Period Extended IE within the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE, the eNB shall take its value into account instead of the value signalled in the Repetition Period IE.
If the M2 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the MCCH related BCCH Extended Configuration Data per MBSFN Area IE, the eNB shall, if supported, broadcast and store the included corresponding configuration of MBSFN area(s) and use it for the duration of the TNL association or until any further configuration update procedure is performed. The eNB shall broadcast the MCCH related BCCH extended configuration only in those cells indicated in the Cell Information List IE contained in the M2 SETUP RESPONSE message for which the Cell Reservation Info IE within the MCCH related BCCH Extended Configuration Item IE is not set to "reserved Cell".
8.6.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.6.2-1. M2 Setup procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the MCE cannot accept the setup it should respond with a M2 SETUP FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.
If the M2 SETUP FAILURE message includes the Time To Wait IE the eNB shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the M2 setup towards the same MCE.
8.6.4	Abnormal Conditions
Void.
8.7	eNB Configuration Update
8.7.1	General
The purpose of the eNB Configuration Update procedure is to update application level configuration data needed for the eNB and MCE to interoperate correctly on the M2 interface. This procedure does not affect existing MBMS-service-related contexts, if any.
The procedure uses non MBMS-service-associated signalling.
8.7.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.2-1. eNB Configuration Update procedure. Successful operation.
The eNB initiates the procedure by sending an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the MCE including an appropriate set of updated configuration data that it has just taken into operational use. The eNB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message may contain:
-	the Global eNB ID IE,
-	the eNB Name IE,
-	the eNB MBMS Configuration data per cell IE.
If the Global eNB ID IE is not included in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MCE shall interpret that the existing eNB ID is not changed.
If the eNB Name IE is not included in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MCE shall interpret that the existing eNB name, if any, is not changed.
The MCE responds with the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to acknowledge that it successfully updated the configuration data. If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message does not contain the information for an existing cell, the MCE shall interpret that the corresponding configuration data for that cell is not changed and shall continue to operate the M2 with the existing related configuration data for that cell.
If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message contains the Cell Information List IE within the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE or within the MCCH related BCCH Extended Configuration Item IE, the eNB shall broadcast that MCCH related BCCH configuration only in those cells indicated in the IE for which the Cell Reservation Info IE is not set to “reservedCell”. If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message does not contain the Cell Information List IE within the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE or within the MCCH related BCCH Extended Configuration Item IE, the eNB shall not broadcast that MCCH related BCCH configuration in any cell. If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message contains the Modification Period Extended IE within the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE, the eNB shall take its value into account instead of the value signalled in the Modification Period IE. If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message contains the Repetition Period Extended IE within the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE, the eNB shall take its value into account instead of the value signalled in the Repetition Period IE. If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message does not contain the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE or the MCCH related BCCH Extended Configuration Item IE for an existing MBSFN area, the eNB shall interpret that the corresponding configuration data for that MBSFN area is not changed and shall continue to operate the M2 with the existing related configuration data for that MBSFN area.
The eNB may update the configured MBMS Services Areas and the MBSFN Synchronisation Area per cell:
-	If the eNB includes the E-UTRAN CGI IE for a cell within the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MCE shall assume that the eNB does neither broadcast MCCH related configuration in the BCCH nor any MBMS service data in that cell any more.
-	If the eNB includes the eNB MBMS Configuration data Item IE for a cell within the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MCE may decide to include in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message the MCCH related BCCH configuration or the MCCH related BCCH extended configuration for the related MBSFN area(s).
If the eNB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the eNB Name IE, the MCE may use this IE as a human readable name of the eNB.
The updated configuration data shall be stored in both eNB and MCE and used for the duration of the TNL association or until any further update is triggered by the eNB or the MCE.
The eNB may initiate a further eNB Configuration Update procedure only after a previous eNB Configuration Update procedure has been completed.
8.7.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.7.3-1. eNB Configuration Update procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the MCE cannot accept the update it shall respond with an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.
If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message includes the Time To Wait IE the eNB shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the ENB Configuration Update procedure towards the MCE. Both nodes shall continue to operate the M2 interface with their respective configuration data.
8.7.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB after initiating eNB Configuration Update procedure receives neither an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKOWLEDGE nor an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message, the eNB may reinitiate a further eNB Configuration Update procedure towards the same MCE, provided that the content of the new ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.
8.8	MCE Configuration Update
8.8.1	General
The purpose of the MCE Configuration Update procedure is to update application level configuration data needed for the eNB and MCE to interoperate correctly on the M2 interface and to re-configure MCCH related content on the BCCH for the MBSFN areas contributed by the eNB which is foreseen to participate in MBMS service data transmission. The procedure uses non MBMS-service-associated signalling. This procedure does not affect existing MBMS-service-related contexts, if any.
8.8.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.8.2-1. MCE Configuration Update procedure. Successful operation.
The MCE initiates the procedure by sending an MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the eNB including an appropriate set of updated configuration data. The MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message may contain:
-	the Global MCE ID IE,
-	the MCE Name IE,
-	the MCCH related BCCH Configuration data per MBSFN area IE.
If the Global MCE ID IE is not included in the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB shall interpret that the existing MCE ID is not changed.
If the MCE Name IE is not included in the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB shall interpret that the existing MCE name, if any, is not changed.
The eNB responds with the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to acknowledge that it successfully updated the configuration data.
If the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the Cell Information List IE within the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE, or within the MCCH related BCCH Extended Configuration Item IE, the eNB shall broadcast that MCCH related BCCH configuration only in those cells indicated in the IE for which the Cell Reservation Info IE is not set to “reservedCell”. If the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message does not contain the Cell Information List IE within the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE, or within the MCCH related BCCH Extended Configuration Item IE, the eNB shall not broadcast that MCCH related BCCH configuration in any cell. If the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the Modification Period Extended IE within the MCCH related BCCH Confiruation Item IE, the eNB shall take its value into account instead of the value signalled in the Modification Period IE. If the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the Repetition Period Extended IE within the MCCH related BCCH Confiruation Item IE, the eNB shall take its value into account instead of the value signalled in the Repetition Period IE. If the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message does not contain the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE, or the MCCH related BCCH Extended Configuration Item IE, for an existing MBSFN area, the eNB shall interpret that the corresponding configuration data for that MBSFN area is not changed and shall continue to operate the M2 with the existing related configuration data for that MBSFN area.
If the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the MCE Name IE, the eNB may use this IE as a human readable name of the MCE.
The updated configuration data shall be stored in both eNB and MCE and used for the duration of the TNL association or until any further update is triggered by the MCE or the eNB.
The MCE may initiate a further MCE Configuration Update procedure only after a previous MCE Configuration Update procedure has been completed.
If the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the Subcarrier Spacing MBMS IE within the MCCH related BCCH Configuration Item IE, the eNB shall, if supported, store this value and use it in MBMS operation.
8.8.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.8.3-1. MCE Configuration Update procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the eNB cannot accept the update it shall respond with an MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.
If the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message includes the Time To Wait IE the MCE shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the MCE Configuration Update procedure towards the eNB. Both nodes shall continue to operate the M2 interface with their respective configuration data.

8.8.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the MCE neither receives an MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE nor an MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message, the MCE may reinitiate MCE Configuration Update procedure towards the same eNB provided that the content of the new MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.
8.9	Error Indication
8.9.1	General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node to report detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising MBMS-service-associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses MBMS-service-associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non MBMS-service-associated signalling.
8.9.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.9.2-1. Error Indication procedure, MCE originated. Successful operation.

Figure 8.9.2.1-2. Error Indication procedure, eNB originated. Successful operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE.
In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by utilising MBMS-service-associated signalling the MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE and the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If one or both of MCE MBMS M2AP ID IE and the eNB MBMS M2AP ID IE are not correct, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. “Unknown or already allocated MCE MBMS M2AP ID”, “Unknown or already allocated eNB MBMS M2AP ID” or “Unknown or inconsistent pair of MBMS M2AP ID”. 
8.9.3	Abnormal Conditions 
Void.
8.10	MBMS Session Update
8.10.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Update procedure is to inform the eNB about changing characteristics of the MBMS session.
The procedure uses MBMS-Service-associated signalling.
8.10.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.10.2-1. MBMS Session Update procedure. Successful operation.
The MCE initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message.
If the MBMS Service Area IE is included in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message, the eNB shall check the involvement of its cells in the new service area, update correspondingly the MBMS context and resources, join or leave the IP multicast if needed and send the MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message.
If the TNL Information IE is included in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message, the eNB shall ignore the contained information.
If the MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message contains the MBMS Session Identity IE for an MBMS service, the eNB shall ignore the contained information. 
If the MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message contains the SC-PTM information IE, the eNB shall check the SC-PTM related involvement of its cells in the new list of Cell identities, update correspondingly the MBMS context and resources, join or leave the IP multicast if needed and send the MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message. If the ARP parameter is updated, the corresponding update of resources shall follow the principles described for the MBMS Session Start procedure. The eNB shall provide the MBMS session only in those cells included in the new list of Cell identities.
8.10.3	Unsuccessful Operation

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.1	General
M2AP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.691 [5] and ITU-T Rec. X.680 [6].
Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the M2AP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of M2AP messages. M2AP messages can contain any Ies specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct an M2AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules (Note that in the following IE means an IE in the object set with an explicit id. If one IE needed to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):
-	Ies shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times Ies may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value “mandatory”. An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value “optional” or “conditional”. If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
If an M2AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
9.3.2	Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor inter-operability.
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.
