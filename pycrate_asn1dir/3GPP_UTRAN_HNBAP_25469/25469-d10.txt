3	Definitions and abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [6] and the following terms and definitions apply:
Elementary Procedure: HNBAP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between the HNB and HNB-GW. These EPs are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as stand-alone procedures, which can be active in parallel. 
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success or failure).
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
   Successful
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
   Unsuccessful
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
-	On time supervision expiry (i.e. absence of expected response).
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
RNSAP Relocation: see definition in TS 25.467 [3].
3.2	Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905 [6] and the following abbreviations apply:
EP	Elementary Procedure
ESN	Electronic Serial Number
HNB	Home Node B
HNB-GW	Home Node B Gateway
HNBAP	HNB Application Part
PDU	Protocol Data Unit
PER	Packed Encoding Rules
SAC	Service Area Code
4	General
The protocol described in the present document is the protocol between HNB-GW and HNB.
4.1	Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the HNB & HNB-GW exactly and completely.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed:
-	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed:
-	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included.
4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include Id and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word  "procedure", e.g. HNB Registration procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. HNB REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. HNB Identity IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in subclause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g., "Abstract Syntax Error (Reject)" or "Background ".
5	HNBAP Services
HNBAP provides the signalling service between the HNB and the HNB-GW that is required to fulfil the HNBAP functions in Clause 7.
6	Services expected from the Transport layer
Following service is expected from the transport layer:
-	reliable and in sequence delivery of HNBAP messages. HNBAP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
7	Functions of HNBAP
The HNBAP has the following functions:
-	HNB Registration
-	UE Registration
-	Support RNSAP relocation (TS 25.467 [3])
-	Error Handling. This function allows the reporting of general error situations, for which function specific error messages have not been defined.
These functions are implemented by one or several HNBAP elementary procedures described in the following clauses.
8	HNBAP Procedures
8.1	Elementary Procedures

8.2	HNB Registration Procedure
8.2.1	General
The purpose of the HNB Registration Procedure is to register the HNB with the HNB-GW to enable the HNB-GW to provide service and core network connectivity for the HNB and if supported and configured, to enable Iurh connectivity via/to the HNB-GW. This procedure shall be the first HNBAP procedure triggered after the Iuh signalling transport has been successfully established.
8.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2-1: HNB Register Procedure: Successful Operation
The HNB shall initiate this procedure by sending a HNB REGISTER REQUEST message whenever it needs to commence operations and requiring service from the HNB-GW.
If the HNB is CSG capable and operates in a Closed access mode as defined in TS 22.220 [15], then it shall provide the CSG-ID IE and may provide the HNB Cell Access Mode IE within the HNB REGISTER REQUEST message.
If the HNB is supporting PWS it shall provide the Service Area For Broadcast IE within the HNB REGISTER REQUEST message.
If the HNB operates in a Hybrid access mode as defined in TS 22.220 [15], then it shall provide the CSG-ID IE and HNB Cell Access Mode IE within the HNB REGISTER REQUEST message.
If the HNB operates in an Open access mode as defined in TS 22.220 [15], then it shall provide the HNB Cell Access Mode IE within the HNB REGISTER REQUEST message.
If the HNB supports direct Iurh connectivity it shall provide the Iurh signalling TNL Address IE to the HNB-GW within the HNB REGISTER REQUEST message.
If supported, the HNB shall include the PSC IE in the HNB REGISTER REQUEST message.
If the registration is successful, the HNB-GW will respond with a HNB REGISTER ACCEPT message indicating acceptance and registration. If the Iurh signalling TNL Address IE is included in the HNB REGISTER ACCEPT message, the HNB shall, if supported, establish a transport layer session to the indicated address to support Iurh connectivity via/to the HNB-GW.
If the HNB-GW is capable of de-multiplexing, then the Mux Port Number IE may be included in the HNB REGISTER ACCEPT message.
If supported, the HNB may include the Tunnel Information IE in the HNB REGISTER REQUEST message.
If the CELL_FACH Mobility Support IE is included in the HNB REGISTER REQUEST message, the HNB-GW shall, if supported, include the S-RNTI Prefix IE and in the HNB REGISTER ACCEPT message.
If included in the HNB REGISTER REQUEST message, the HNB-GW may use the Neighbour Cell Identity List IE, the URA Identity List IE or the HNB Capacity IE when assigning the S-RNTI Prefix IE to the HNB.
8.2.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.2.3-1: HNB Register Procedure: Un-Successful Operation
If the HNB-GW cannot register the HNB, the HNB-GW will respond with a HNB REGISTER REJECT message.
Typical cause values are:
Radio Network Layer Cause:
-	Unauthorised Location
-	Unauthorised HNB
-	Overload
-	HNB Parameter Mismatch
-	Unspecified
If the Cause IE in the HNB REGISTER REJECT message is set to "overload", the HNB shall not retry registration to the same HNB-GW for at least the duration indicated in the Backoff Timer IE.
8.2.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the HNB-GW receives a duplicate HNB REGISTER REQUEST (i.e. for an already registered HNB identified by the same unique HNB identity), then the new HNB REGISTER REQUEST shall override the existing registration and the handling of the new HNB REGISTER REQUEST shall be performed according to subclause 8.2.
8.3	HNB De-registration Procedure
8.3.1	Successful Operation (HNB Originated)

Figure 8.3.1-1: HNB De-register Procedure: Successful Operation

8.3.3	Abnormal Conditions
-
8.4	UE Registration
8.4.1	General
The UE Registration procedure provides means for the HNB to convey UE identification data to the HNB-GW in order to perform access control for the UE in the HNB-GW.  The UE Registration also establishes a UE specific context identifier to be used between HNB and HNB-GW. The procedure is triggered when the UE attempts to access the HNB via an initial NAS message and there is no context in the HNB allocated for that UE.
8.4.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.2-1: UE Register Procedure: Successful Operation
The HNB shall initiate the procedure by sending a UE REGISTER REQUEST message to the HNB-GW including UE specific data. The HNB shall always include within the UE Identity IE the UE permanent identity (i.e. IMSI) if it does not serve a CSG cell or for registration of UEs without CSG capability except if the Registration Cause IE indicates "emergency call".
The HNB-GW shall perform access control or membership verification in case of non-CSG UEs or non-CSG HNBs. If the HNB does not operate in closed access mode or access control is successful, the HNB-GW shall respond with a UE REGISTER ACCEPT message including the Context-ID IE. 
The UE REGISTER ACCEPT message may include the CSG Membership Status IE for the UE registering to the cell.
The HNB-GW shall not perform access control if the Registration Cause IE indicates "emergency call".
8.4.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.4.3-1: UE Register Procedure: Unsuccessful Operation
If the HNB-GW is unable to accept the UE registration it shall reject the procedure with a UE REGISTER REJECT message. 
Typical Cause values:
Radio Network Layer Cause:
-	Invalid UE identity
-	UE not allowed on this HNB
-	HNB not registered
-	Unspecified
8.4.4	Abnormal Conditions
-
8.5	UE De-Registration
8.5.1	General

8.10	HNB Configuration Transfer Procedure
8.10.1	General
The purpose of the HNB Configuration Transfer procedure is to obtain IP address information and other necessary information for establishing Iurh connections between HNBs.
8.10.2	Successful Operation


Figure 8.10.2-1: HNB Configuration Transfer Procedure: Successful Operation
The HNB initiates this procedure by sending an HNB CONFIGURATION TRANSFER REQUEST message to the HNB-GW in order to retrieve the IP address and other necessary information for each neighbour HNB indicated in the Neighbour Information Request List IE. The HNB shall only request configuration information for those neighbour HNBs for which information has not already been received.
The HNB CONFIGURATION TRANSFER REQUEST shall contain information for all requested neighbour HNBs in the Neighbour Information Request List IE. Available neighbour information shall be indicated in the HNB Configuration Information Provided IE, if no neighbour information is available this shall be indicated in the HNB Configuration Information Missing IE with the Cause IE set to an appropriate value.
If the HNB indicated the support for CELL_FACH/CELL_PCH/URA_PCH mobility at registration, the HNB-GW shall include the S-RNTI prefixes of the neighbour HNBs in the Neighbour Information List IE of the HNB CONFIGURATION TRANSFER RESPONSE message. If the HNB is also configured with a URA, the HNB-GW may include in the Neighbour Information List IE of the HNB CONFIGURATION TRANSFER RESPONSE message the URA Identity List IE of the neighbour HNBs.
For each available neighbour information within the Neighbour Information List IE in the HNB CONFIGURATION TRANSFER RESPONSE message the HNB attempts establishing a transport layer session using the addresses provided in an ordered manner starting with the first entry of the list, if none is established yet, and an Iurh connection towards the related neighbour HNB.

Subclause 9.2 presents the HNBAP IE definitions in tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.3. In case there is contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information;

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.0	General
HNBAP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.680 [8] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [9].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of HNBAP messages. HNBAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct a HNBAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules (Note that in the following IE means an IE in the object set with an explicit id. If one IE needed to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
If a HNBAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax error in subclause 10.3.6.
9.3.1	Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor interoperability;
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.

9.4	Message Transfer Syntax
HNBAP shall use the ASN.1 Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER) Aligned Variant as transfer syntax as specified in ref. ITU-T Rec. X.691 [7].
10	Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data
10.1	General
Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:
-	Transfer Syntax Error;
-	Abstract Syntax Error;
-	Logical Error.
Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving node:

Figure 10.1-1: Protocol Errors in HNBAP
The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included in the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be included. Other optional information elements within the message may also be included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the reporting is done with a response message. The latter is an exception to what is stated in subclause 4.1.
10.2	Transfer Syntax Error
A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode the received physical message Transfer syntax errors are always detected in the process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error occurs, the receiver should initiate Error Indication procedure with appropriate cause value for the Transfer Syntax protocol error.
10.3	Abstract Syntax Error
10.3.1	General
An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional HNBAP entity:
1.	receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE id);
2.	receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g.: ASN.1 definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10 (values 11 to 15 are undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an abstract syntax error using criticality information sent by the originator of the message);
3.	does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence of the concerning object, the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the received message;
4.	receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group;
5.	receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the concerning object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE groups should not have been present in the received message.
Cases 1 and 2 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on received Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is handled based on Criticality information and Presence information for the missing IE/IE group specified in the version of the specification used by the receiver. Case 4 (IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences) and Case 5 (erroneously present conditional IEs or IE groups) result in rejecting the procedure.
If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the remaining message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error act according to the Criticality Information and Presence Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract Syntax Error occurred in accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is specified in subclause 10.3.6.
10.3.2	Criticality Information
In the HNBAP messages there is criticality information set for individual IEs and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver how to act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended i.e. the entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully or partially) comprehended shall be treated in accordance with its own criticality information as specified in subclause 10.3.4.
In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing IE/IE group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).
The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the Criticality Information. The three possible values of the Criticality Information for an IE/IE group are:
-	Reject IE;
-	Ignore IE and Notify Sender;
-	Ignore IE.
The following rules restrict when a receiving entity may consider an IE, an IE group or an EP not comprehended (not implemented), and when action based on criticality information is applicable:
1.	IE or IE group: When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, then other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered comprehended by the receiving entity (some may still remain unsupported).
2.	EP: The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not supported may be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from that standard version is comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.
10.3.3	Presence Information
For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1 transfer syntax, HNBAP specifies separately if the presence of these IEs/IE groups is optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application by means of the presence field of the concerning object of class HNBAP-PROTOCOL-IES, HNBAP-PROTOCOL-IES-PAIR, HNBAP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or HNBAP-PRIVATE-IES.
The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:
1.	Optional;
2.	Conditional;
3.	Mandatory.
If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence of the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the condition is true according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE group.
10.3.4	Not comprehended IE/IE group
10.3.4.1	Procedure Code
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality information of the Procedure Code according to the following:
Reject IE:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure Code marked with "Reject IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall reject the procedure using the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure Code marked with "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure Code marked with "Ignore IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the procedure.
When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to report an ignored procedure it shall include the Procedure Code IE, the Triggering Message IE, and the Procedure Criticality IE in the Criticality Diagnostics IE.
10.3.4.1A	Type of Message
When the receiving node cannot decode the Type of Message IE, the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
10.3.4.2	IEs other than the Procedure Code and Type of Message
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality information of an IE/IE group other than the Procedure Code IE and Type of Message IE according to the following:
Reject IE:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Reject IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the rejection of one or more IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Reject IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs marked with "Reject IE" which the receiving node does no comprehend, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more Ies/IE groups marked with "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	if a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IE/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Ignore IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using only the understood IEs/IE groups.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Ignore IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with "Reject IE" or "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" using a response message defined for the procedure, the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with "Reject IE" or "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" using the Error Indication procedure, the Procedure Code IE, the Triggering Message IE, Procedure Criticality IE, and the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group.
10.3.5	Missing IE or IE group
The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received message specified in the version of the present document used by the receiver:
Reject IE:
-	if a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Reject IE"; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	if a received message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Reject IE", the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	if a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Reject IE, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	if a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Ignore IE and Notify Sender", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	if a received message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Ignore IE and Notify Sender", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
-	if a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Ignore IE and Notify Sender", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
Ignore IE:
-	if a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Ignore IE", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
-	if a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Ignore IE", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Reject IE" or "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" using a response message defined for the procedure, the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Reject IE" or "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" using the Error Indication procedure, the Procedure Code IE, the Triggering Message IE, Procedure Criticality IE, and the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group.
10.3.6	IEs or IE groups received in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present
If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional presence are present when the condition is not met (i.e. erroneously present), the receiving node shall behave according to the following:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value "Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)" using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure, and use cause value "Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)".
-	If a response message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the specification version used by the receiver shall be considered.
10.4	Logical Error
Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly, but the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e. semantic error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with the state of the receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour shall be performed (unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class of the elementary procedure, irrespective of the criticality information of the IE's/IE groups containing the erroneous values.
Class 1:
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1 procedure, and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. Typical cause values are:
-	Semantic Error;
-	Message not compatible with receiver state.
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1 procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure Code IE and the Triggering Message IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
Class 2:
Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure Code IE and the Triggering Message IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
10.5	Exceptions
The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take precedence over any other error handling described in the other subclauses of clause 10.
-	If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local error handling.
-	In case a response message or Error Indication message needs to be returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
-	If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause value shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality “ignore and notify” have earlier occurred within the same procedure.
