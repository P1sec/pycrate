3	Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions below apply. Terms and definitions not defined below can be found in TR 21.905 [35].
Cell Load-Based Inter-System Handover: This mechanism, which is contained within a UTRAN RNC, consists of three primary functions:
1.	The RNC has the capability to generate and send Cell Load Information towards the target/source system.
2.	The RNC has the capability to receive Cell Load Information from the target/source system, and is able to interpret this information.
3.	The ability of the RNC to make a handover decision by comparing the Cell Load Information that it has received from the target system with the Cell Load Information it has about its own cells.
Ciphering Alternative: defines both the Ciphering Status (started/not started) together with the Ciphering Algorithm considered altogether.
Core Network operator: as defined in TS 23.251 [39].
Corresponding RNC-ID: RNC-ID corresponding to an eNB ID, which enables a source RNC to address a target eNB for handover purposes via CN elements that cannot interprete an eNB ID (see TS 23.401 [48]).
CSG Cell: a UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG Indicator and a CSG identity. This cell operates in Closed Access Mode as defined in TS 22.220 [56].
DCN-ID: DCN identity identifies a specific decicated core network (DCN).
Default CN node: An RNC with an inactive or not implemented NAS Node Selection Function TS 23.236 [26] has one single permanent default CN node per CN domain. It always initiates the Initial UE Message procedure towards its default CN node. If the NAS Node Selection Function is active, then no Default CN node exists.
Directed retry: Directed retry is the process of assigning a User Equipment to a radio resource that does not belong to the serving RNC e.g. in situations of congestion. It is triggered by the RAB Assignment procedure and employs relocation procedures.
Elementary Procedure: RANAP protocol consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between the RNS and the CN. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as stand alone procedures, which can be active in parallel. Examples on using several RANAP EPs together with each other and EPs from other interfaces can be found in reference TR 25.931 [4].
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Three kinds of EPs are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
-	Class 3: Elementary Procedures with possibility of multiple responses.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
-	On time supervision expiry (i.e. absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
-	One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined for successful outcome.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
Class 3 EPs have one or several response messages reporting both successful, unsuccessful outcome of the requests and temporary status information about the requests. This type of EP only terminates through response(s) or EP timer expiry.
Enhanced relocation: denotes a method where the relocation of the SRNS functionality is prepared via RNSAP means. The CN is not informed until the preparation and execution of the relocation has taken place.
Gateway Core Network: as defined in TS 23.251 [39].
GERAN BSC in Iu mode: In the context of this specification no distinction between an UTRAN RNC and a GERAN BSC in Iu mode is made. The GERAN BSC in Iu mode will behave as a RNC unless explicitely stated (see TS 43.051 [27]).
Hybrid Cell: a UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG Identity and operating in Hybrid Access Mode as defined in TS 22.220 [56].
Integrity Protection Alternative: defines both the Integrity Protection Status (started/not started) together with the Integrity Protection Algorithm considered altogether.
Local Home Network: as defined in TS 23.060 [21].
Management Based Activation: as defined in TS 32.421 [37].
MBMS Bearer Service: as defined in TS 23.246 [41].
MBMS Iu signalling connection: as defined in TS 25.346 [42].

MBMS Service Area: as defined in TS 23.246 [41].
MBMS Service Context: as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
MBMS Session: as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
MBMS session start: as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
MBMS session stop: as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
Multicast Service: as defined in TS 22.146 [40].
Multi-Operator Core Network: as defined in TS 23.251 [39].
Network sharing non-supporting UE: as defined in TS 23.251 [39].
Network sharing supporting UE: as defined in TS 23.251 [39].
Packet System Information: as defined in TS 44.060 [46].
PUESBINE feature: as defined in TS 23.195 [33].
Relocation of SRNS: relocation of SRNS is a UMTS functionality used to relocate the serving RNS role from one RNS to another RNS. This UMTS functionality is realised by several elementary procedures executed in several interfaces and by several protocols and it may involve a change in the radio resources used between UTRAN and UE
It is also possible to relocate the serving RNS role from:
-	one RNS within UMTS to another relocation target external to UMTS;
-	functionality equivalent to the serving RNS role from another relocation source external to UMTS to another RNS.
RAN Information Management: as defined in TS 48.018 [36].
RNSAP Relocation: see definition in TS 25.467 [55].
Trace Recording Session: as defined in TS 32.421 [37].
Trace Recording Session Reference: as defined in TS 32.421 [37].
Trace Reference: as defined in TS 32.421 [37].
Trace Session: as defined in TS 32.421 [37].
Serving RNC: SRNC is the RNC belonging to SRNS
Serving RNS: role an RNS can take with respect to a specific connection between an UE and UTRAN. There is one serving RNS for each UE that has a connection to UTRAN. The serving RNS is in charge of the radio connection between a UE and the UTRAN. The serving RNS terminates the Iu for this UE
Signalling Based Activation: as defined in TS 32.421 [37].
Source RNC: source RNC is the RNC belonging to source RNS
Source RNS: role, with respect to a specific connection between UTRAN and CN, that RNS takes when it decides to initiate a relocation of SRNS
System Information in GERAN: as defined in TS 44.018 [45].
Target RNC: target RNC is the RNC belonging to target RNS
Target RNS: role an RNS gets with respect to a specific connection between UTRAN and CN when it is being a subject of a relocation of SRNS which is being made towards that RNS
UE Specific Behaviour Information – Iu: as defined in TS 23.195 [33].

4.1	Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the RNC exactly and completely. The CN functional behaviour is left unspecified. The EPs Relocation Preparation, Reset, Reset Resource and Overload Control are exceptions from this principle.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 of Class 3 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see section 10. For examples on how to use the Criticality Diagnostics IE, see Annex A.2.
4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g. RAB Assignment procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. User Plane Mode IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in subclause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Abstract Syntax Error (Reject)" or "Geographical Coordinates".
5	RANAP Services
RANAP provides the signalling service between UTRAN or GERAN (in Iu mode) and CN that is required to fulfil the RANAP functions described in clause 7. RANAP services are divided into four groups. The first three are based on Service Access Points (SAP) defined in TS 23.110 [16]:
1.	General control services: They are related to the whole Iu interface instance between RNC and logical CN domain, and are accessed in CN through the General Control SAP. They utilise connectionless signalling transport provided by the Iu signalling bearer.
2.	Notification services: They are related to specified UEs or all UEs in specified area, and are accessed in CN through the Notification SAP. They utilise connectionless signalling transport provided by the Iu signalling bearer.
3.	Dedicated control services: They are related to one UE, and are accessed in CN through the Dedicated Control SAP. RANAP functions that provide these services are associated with Iu signalling connection that is maintained for the UE in question. The Iu signalling connection is realised with connection oriented signalling transport provided by the Iu signalling bearer.
4.	MBMS control services: They are related to one MBMS Bearer Service. RANAP functions that provide these services are associated with one or several Iu signalling connection that is maintained for the MBMS Bearer Service in question during the MBMS Session. The Iu signalling connection is realised with connection oriented signalling transport provided by the Iu signalling bearer.
6	Services Expected from Signalling Transport
Signalling transport (See TS 25.412 [5]) shall provide two different service modes for the RANAP.
1.	Connection oriented data transfer service. This service is supported by a signalling connection between RNC and CN domain. It shall be possible to dynamically establish and release signalling connections based on the need. Each active UE shall have its own signalling connection. Each MBMS Bearer Service during a given MBMS Session shall have one or several signalling connections. The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of RANAP messages. RANAP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
2.	Connectionless data transfer service. RANAP shall be notified in case a RANAP message did not reach the intended peer RANAP entity.
7	Functions of RANAP
RANAP protocol has the following functions:
-	Relocating serving RNC. This function enables to change the serving RNC functionality as well as the related Iu resources (RAB(s) and Signalling connection) from one RNC to another.
-	Overall RAB management. This function is responsible for setting up, modifying and releasing RABs.
-	Queuing the setup of RAB. The purpose of this function is to allow placing some requested RABs into a queue, and indicate the peer entity about the queuing.
-	Requesting RAB release. While the overall RAB management is a function of the CN, the RNC has the capability to request the release of RAB.
-	Release of all Iu connection resources. This function is used to explicitly release all resources related to one Iu connection.
-	Requesting the release of all Iu connection resources. While the Iu release is managed from the CN, the RNC has the capability to request the release of all Iu connection resources from the corresponding Iu connection.
-	SRNS context forwarding function. This function is responsible for transferring SRNS context from the RNC to the CN for intersystem change in case of packet forwarding.
-	Controlling overload in the Iu interface. This function allows adjusting the load in the control plane of the Iu interface.
-	Resetting the Iu. This function is used for resetting an Iu interface.
-	Sending the UE Common ID (permanent NAS UE identity) to the RNC. This function makes the RNC aware of the UE's Common ID.
-	Paging the user. This function provides the CN for capability to page the UE.
-	Controlling the tracing of the subscriber or user equipment activity. This function allows setting the trace mode for a given subscriber or user equipment. This function also allows the deactivation of a previously established trace.
-	MDT function. This function is to enable the transfer of MDT measurements collected by the UE.
-	Transport of NAS information between UE and CN (see TS 24.008 [8]). This function has two sub-classes:
1.	Transport of the initial NAS signalling message from the UE to CN. This function transfers transparently the NAS information. As a consequence also the Iu signalling connection is set up.
2.	Transport of NAS signalling messages between UE and CN, This function transfers transparently the NAS signalling messages on the existing Iu signalling connection. It also includes a specific service to handle signalling messages differently.
-	Controlling the security mode in the UTRAN. This function is used to send the security keys (ciphering and integrity protection) to the UTRAN, and setting the operation mode for security functions.
-	Controlling location reporting. This function allows the CN to operate the mode in which the UTRAN reports the location of the UE.
-	Location reporting. This function is used for transferring the actual location information from RNC to the CN.
-	Data volume reporting function. This function is responsible for reporting unsuccessfully transmitted DL data volume over UTRAN for specific RABs.
-	Reporting general error situations. This function allows reporting of general error situations, for which function specific error messages have not been defined.
-	Location related data. This function allows the CN to either retrieve from the RNC deciphering keys (to be forwarded to the UE) for the broadcast assistance data, or request the RNC to deliver dedicated assistance data to the UE.
-	Information Transfer. This function allows the CN to transfer information to the RNC.
-	Uplink Information Exchange. This function allows the RNC to transfer or request information to the CN. For instance the RNC has the capability to request MBMS specific information to the CN e.g. the Multicast Service lists for a given UE or the IP Multicast Address and APN for one or several MBMS Bearer Services.
-	MBMS RANAP overall function. This function allows the following different sub-functions:
-	MBMS RAB management. This function is responsible for setting up, updating and releasing the MBMS RAB as well as the MBMS Iu signalling connection corresponding to one MBMS Session. The MBMS RAB is defined for the CN PS domain only.
-	MBMS CN (PS domain) de-registration. This function makes the RNC aware that a given Multicast Service is no longer available.
-	MBMS UE linking/de-linking. This function makes the RNC aware that a given UE, with existing Iu-ps signalling connection, has joined/left some Multicast Service(s).
-	Requesting MBMS Service registration/de-registration. While the overall MBMS CN de-registration is a function of the CN (PS domain), the RNC has the capability to register/de-register to a specific Multicast Service.
-	QoE function. This function is to enable the transfer of QoE measurements collected by the UE.
These functions are implemented by one or several RANAP elementary procedures described in the following clause.

8.2	RAB Assignment
8.2.1	General
The purpose of the RAB Assignment procedure is to establish new RABs and/or to enable modifications and/or releases of already established RABs for a given UE. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 1: RAB Assignment procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message. When sending the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the CN shall start the T RABAssgt timer.
The CN may request the UTRAN to:
-	establish,
-	modify,
-	release
one or several RABs with one RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.
The CN shall include in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message at least one request to either establish/modify or release a RAB.
The message shall contain the information required by the UTRAN to build the new RAB configuration, such as:
-	list of RABs to establish or modify with their bearer characteristics;
-	list of RABs to release;
-	UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (if available).
For each RAB requested to be established, the message shall contain:
-	RAB ID;
-	NAS Synchronisation Indicator (only when available);
-	RAB parameters (including e.g. Allocation/Retention Priority);
-	User Plane Information (i.e. required User Plane Mode and required UP Mode Versions);
-	Transport Layer Information;
-	PDP Type Information (only for PS) or PDP Type Information extension (only for PS);
-	Data Volume Reporting Indication (only for PS);
-	DL GTP-PDU sequence number (only when GTP-PDU sequence number is available in cases of intersystem change from GPRS to UMTS or when establishing a RAB for an existing PDP context or in some further cases described in TS 23.060 [21]);
-	UL GTP-PDU sequence number (only when GTP-PDU sequence number is available in cases of intersystem change from GPRS to UMTS or when establishing a RAB for an existing PDP context or in some further cases described in TS 23.060 [21]);
-	DL N-PDU sequence number (only when N-PDU sequence number is available in case of intersystem change from GPRS to UMTS or in some further cases described in TS 23.060 [21]);
-	UL N-PDU sequence number (only when N-PDU sequence number is available in case of intersystem change from GPRS to UMTS or in some further cases described in TS 23.060 [21]).
The RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message shall, if supported, include the Correlation ID IE for each RAB established towards a L-GW collocated with the RNC for LIPA operation.
If the SIPTO Correlation ID IE is included in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message towards the RNC with L-GW function for SIPTO@LN operation, the RNC shall use it for SIPTO@LN operation for the concerned RAB.
For each RAB requested to be modified, the message may contain:
-	RAB ID (mandatory);
-	NAS Synchronisation Indicator;
-	RAB parameters;
-	Transport Layer Information;
-	User Plane Information.
If the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is present in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the UTRAN shall, if supported, store the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate data rate of non-GBR traffic for this UE.
The Transport Layer Information IE may be present at a RAB modification except in the case when the only other present IE, besides the RAB ID IE, is the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE.
At a RAB modification that does not include transfer of the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE, the RAB Parameters IE shall be present in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message only when any previously set value for this IE is requested to be modified.
At a RAB modification, the User Plane Information IE shall be present in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message only when any previously set value for this IE is requested to be modified.
For a RAB setup, the SDU Format Information Parameter IE in the RAB Parameters IE shall be present only if the User Plane Mode IE is set to "support mode for pre-defined SDU sizes" and the Traffic Class IE is set to either "Conversational" or "Streaming".
For a RAB setup or modification, when the maximum bit rate (respectively the guaranteed bit rate when applicable) to be signalled for the RAB exceeds the maximum value of the Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Guaranteed Bit Rate IE), either the Extended Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) shall be included together with the Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) set to its maximum value or the Supported Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) shall be used.
For a RAB setup or modification, if the Extended Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) is present, the RNC shall consider it and ignore the Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Guaranteed Bit Rate IE).
For a RAB if Extended Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Guaranteed Bit Rate IE when applicable) is signalled in one direction RNC shall use the Extended Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) also for the other direction for this RAB. If the Supported Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) is present, it shall be used in both directions.
For a RAB setup or modification, if the Supported Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) is present, the RNC shall consider it and ignore the Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Guaranteed Bit Rate IE).
For a RAB setup, the RAB Parameters IE may contain the Signalling Indication IE. The Signalling Indication IE shall not be present if the Traffic Class IE is not set to "Interactive" or if the CN Domain Indicator IE is not set to "PS domain".
If the RAB Parameters IE is present for a RAB modification, the SDU Format Information Parameter IE in the RAB Parameters IE shall be present only if the Traffic Class IE is set to either "Conversational" or "Streaming" and if
-	either the User Plane mode is currently "support mode for pre-defined SDU sizes" and the User Plane Mode IE is not contained in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message
-	or if the User Plane Mode IE optionally contained within the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message is set to "support mode for pre-defined SDU sizes".
If, for a RAB requested to be modified, one (or more) of these IEs except RAB ID IE are not present in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message the RNC shall continue to use the value(s) currently in use for the not present IEs.
If, for a RAB requested to be modified, the Signalling Indication IE is not present and the Traffic Class IE is set to "interactive", this indicates that the signalling nature of the RAB is not changed by the modification.
For each RAB requested to be released, the message shall contain:
-	RAB ID;
-	Cause.
Upon reception of the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the UTRAN shall execute the requested RAB configuration. The CN may indicate that RAB QoS negotiation is allowed for certain RAB parameters and in some cases also which alternative values to be used in the negotiation in the Alternative RAB parameters values IE.
If some of the alternative maximum bit rates (respectively alternative guaranteed bit rates when applicable) to be signalled for the RAB exceed the maximum value of the Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE), they shall be included either in the Extended Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE, or in the Supported Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE). If the Supported Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) is used it shall be used for all alternative bitrate definitions for the RAB.
For a RAB setup or modification, if the Extended Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) is present, the RNC shall consider these rates together with the bit rates signalled within the Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) if present.
For an entry in the list or for a discrete value if the Extended Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE when applicabale) is signalled in one direction RNC shall use the Extended Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) also for the other direction of this entry or discrete value. If the Supported Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) is present it shall be used in both directions for all entries in the list or discrete values.
For a RAB setup or RAB requested to be modified, the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message may also include an alternative RAB configuration specified in the Alternative RAB configuration IE in the Alternative RAB Parameter Values IE. If Alternative RAB configuration IE for a RAB is included in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the RNC is allowed after the successful RAB setup or RAB modification to request the CN to trigger the execution of this alternative RAB configuration. No negotiation is allowed during the RAB Assignment procedure between the requested RAB configuration and this alternative RAB configuration. 
If the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message contains a request of a RAB configuration with Extended Maximum Bit Rate IE and/or Extended Guaranteed Bit Rate IE respectively if Supported Maximum Bit Rate IE and/or Supported Guaranteed Bit Rate IE are greater than 16 Mbps in RAB parameters IE, the CN should indicate that RAB QoS negotiation is allowed. If this RAB Configuration is for a UE that is not able to support the requested bit rates according to the Access Stratum Release Indicator IE in TS 25.331 [10]:
-	The UTRAN shall, if supported, perform RAB QoS negotiation.
- 	If RAB QoS negotiation is performed, the RNC shall signal the assigned bit rate indications within the Assigned RAB Parameter Values IE in the following way:
-	Extended Assigned Maximum Bit Rate IE and Extended Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate IE shall not be set in Assigned RAB Parameter Values IE;
-	if the Supported Assigned Maximum Bit Rate IE and Supported Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate IE are used, they shall be set to a value less than or equal to 16 Mbps.
The same RAB ID shall only be present once in the whole RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.
The RAB ID shall uniquely identify the RAB for the specific CN domain and for the particular UE, which makes the RAB ID unique over the Iu connection on which the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message is received. When a RAB ID already in use over that particular Iu instance is used, the procedure is considered as modification of that RAB.
The RNC shall pass the contents of the RAB ID IE to the radio interface protocol for each RAB requested to be established or modified.
The RNC shall establish or modify the resources according to the values of the Allocation/Retention Priority IE (priority level, pre-emption indicators, queuing) and the resource situation as follows:
-	The RNC shall consider the priority level of the requested RAB, when deciding on the resource allocation.
-	If the requested RAB is allowed for queuing and the resource situation requires so, the RNC may place the RAB in the establishment queue.
-	The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (singularly or in combination) be used to determine whether the RAB assignment has to be performed unconditionally and immediately. If the requested RAB is marked as "may trigger pre-emption" and the resource situation requires so, the RNC may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced release of a lower priority RAB which is marked as "pre-emptable". Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption procedure is operator-dependent, the pre-emption indicators, if given in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, shall be treated as follows:
1.	The values of the last received Pre-emption Vulnerability IE and Priority Level IE shall prevail.
2.	If the Pre-emption Capability IE is set to "may trigger pre-emption", then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption procedure.
3.	If the Pre-emption Capability IE is set to "shall not trigger pre-emption", then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption procedure.
4.	If the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE is set to "pre-emptable", then this connection shall be included in the pre-emption process.
5.	If the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE is set to "not pre-emptable", then this connection shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
6.	If the Priority Level IE is set to "no priority" the given values for the Pre-emption Capability IE and Pre-emption Vulnerability IE shall not be considered. Instead the values "shall not trigger pre-emption" and "not pre-emptable" shall prevail.
-	If the Allocation/Retention Priority IE is not given in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption process and the connection may be pre-empted and considered to have the value "lowest" as priority level. Moreover, queuing shall not be allowed.
-	The UTRAN pre-emption process shall keep the following rules:
1.	UTRAN shall only pre‑empt RABs with lower priority, in ascending order of priority.
2.	The pre-emption may be done for RABs belonging to the same UE or to other UEs.
If the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE is contained in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the RNC shall pass it to the radio interface protocol for transfer to the UE.
If the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message includes the PDP Type Information IE or PDP Type Information extension IE, the UTRAN may use it to configure any compression algorithms.
If included, the Service Handover IE tells if the requested RAB
-	should be handed over to GSM, i.e. from a NAS point of view, the requested RAB should be handed over to GSM as soon as possible although the final decision whether to perform a handover to GSM is still made in the UTRAN.
-	should not be handed over to GSM, i.e. from a NAS point of view, the requested RAB should remain in UMTS as long as possible although the final decision whether to perform a handover to GSM is still made in the UTRAN.
-	shall not be handed over to GSM, i.e. the requested RAB shall never be handed over to GSM. This means that the UTRAN shall not initiate handover to GSM for the UE unless the RABs with this indication have first been released with the normal release procedures.
The value of the Service Handover IE is valid throughout the lifetime of the RAB or until changed by a RAB modification.
The Service Handover IE shall only influence decisions made regarding UTRAN-initiated inter-system handovers.
If the Service Handover IE is not included during RAB Setup and all subsequent RAB Modifications, the decision whether to perform an inter-system handover to GSM is only an internal UTRAN matter.
If included, the E-UTRAN Service Handover IE tells if the requested RAB is allowed to be handed over to E-UTRAN.
If the E-UTRAN service handover function is supported,
-	The RNC shall not trigger handover or redirection to E-UTRAN for a UE with a signalling connection only;
-	The RNC shall not trigger handover or redirection to E-UTRAN for a UE if all established RABs have E-UTRAN Service Handover IE set to “Handover to E-UTRAN shall not be performed”.
The value of the E-UTRAN Service Handover IE is valid throughout the lifetime of the RAB or until changed by a RAB modification.
If the E-UTRAN Service Handover IE is not included during RAB Setup and all subsequent RAB Modifications, the decision whether to perform an inter-system mobility to E-UTRAN, e.g., handover or redirection, is only an internal UTRAN matter.
The UTRAN shall report to the CN, in the first RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message, the result for all the requested RABs, such as:
-	List of RABs successfully established or modified.
-	List of RABs released.
-	List of RABs queued.
-	List of RABs failed to establish or modify.
-	List of RABs failed to release.
The same RAB ID shall only be present once in the whole RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
For each RAB successfully established towards the PS domain or towards the CS domain when an ALCAP is not used, the RNC shall include the Transport Layer Address IE and the Iu Transport Association IE in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
For each RAB successfully released towards the PS domain, for which data volume reporting had been requested when the RAB was established, the RNC shall include the DL Data Volumes IE in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message. The DL Data Volumes IE shall contain in the Unsuccessfully Transmitted DL Data Volume IE the total amount of unsuccessfully transmitted DL data for the RAB since its establishment and may contain the Data Volume Reference IE.
For each RAB successfully released towards the PS domain, the RNC shall include in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message the DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE and the UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE, if available and if the release was initiated by the UTRAN.
The RNC shall report in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message at least one RAB:
-	setup/modified or
-	released or
-	queued or
-	failed to setup/modify or
-	failed to release.
If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used when establishing or modifying a RAB, these RAB parameter values shall be included in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message within the Assigned RAB Parameter Values IE.
If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used from the Extended Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE), these RAB parameter values shall be included in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message within the Extended Assigned Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate IE).
For a RAB if the Extended Assigned Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate IE when applicable) is signalled in one direction RNC shall signal the Extended Assigned Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) also in the other direction for this RAB. If the Supported Assigned Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) is used it shall be used in both directions.
If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used from the Supported Alternative Maximum Bit Rate Information IE (respectively Supported Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate Information IE), these RAB parameter values shall be included in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message within the Supported Assigned Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate IE).
For the CS domain, when an ALCAP is used, UTRAN shall report the successful outcome of a specific RAB to establish or modify only after the Iu user plane at RNL level is ready to be used in UL and DL. At a RAB establishment, the transport network control plane signalling required to set up the transport bearer shall use the Transport Layer Address IE and Iu Transport Association IE. At a RAB modification when Transport Layer Address (IE) and Iu Transport Association IEs are included, the RNC shall establish a new transport bearer. The transport network control plane signalling shall then use the included Transport Layer Address IE and Iu Transport Association IE. Then the switch over to this new transport bearer shall be done immediately after transport bearer establishment and initialisation of the user plane mode. If Transport Layer Address (IE) and Iu Transport Association IEs are not included, then the RNC may modify the already existing transport bearer.
For the PS domain or for the CS domain when an ALCAP is not used, when they are present at a RAB modification, the RNC shall use the embedded Transport Layer Address IE and Iu Transport Association IEs as the termination point of the new transport bearer.
For the PS domain or for the CS domain when an ALCAP is not used, for each RAB successfully modified, if the RNC has changed the Transport Layer Address IE and/or the Iu Transport Association IE, it shall include the new value(s) in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
Before reporting the successful outcome of a specific RAB to establish or modify, the RNC shall have executed the initialisation of the user plane, if necessary.
Re-initialisation of the user plane shall not be performed if:
-	the RAB Parameters IE is not included, for example during transfer of NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE;
-	the RAB Parameters IE is included but the SDU Format Information Parameter IE is not changed for the existing RAB and the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE is not included.
Re-initialisation of the user plane shall be performed if the RAB Parameters IE and NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE are included.
If the RNC can not initialise the requested user plane mode for any of the user plane mode versions in the UP Mode Versions IE according to the rules for initialisation of the respective user plane mode versions, as described in TS 25.415 [6], the RAB Assignment shall fail with the cause value "RNC unable to establish all RFCs".
In case of establishment of a RAB for the PS domain, the CN must be prepared to receive user data before the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message has been received.
If none of the RABs have been queued, the CN shall stop timer T RABAssgt and the RAB Assignment procedure terminates. In that case, the procedure shall also be terminated in the UTRAN.
When the request to establish or modify one or several RABs is put in a queue, the UTRAN shall start the timer TQUEUING. This timer specifies the maximum time for queuing of the request for establishment or modification. The same timer TQUEUING supervises all RABs of the request being queued.
For each RAB that is queued the following outcomes are possible:
-	successfully established or modified;
-	failed to establish or modify;
-	failed due to expiry of the timer TQUEUING.
For RABs indicated as queued in the first RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message, the UTRAN shall report the outcome of the queuing for every RAB individually or for several RABs in subsequent RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message(s). This is left to implementation. The UTRAN shall stop TQUEUING when all RABs have been either successfully established or modified or failed to establish or modify. The RAB Assignment procedure is then terminated both in the CN and the UTRAN when all RABs have been responded to.
When the CN receives the response that one or several RABs are queued, it shall expect the UTRAN to provide the outcome of the queuing function for each RAB before expiry of the T RABAssgt timer. In case the timer T RABAssgt expires, the CN shall consider the RAB Assignment procedure terminated and the RABs not reported shall be considered as failed.
In case the timer TQUEUING expires, the RAB Assignment procedure terminates in the UTRAN for all queued RABs, and the UTRAN shall respond for all of them in one RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message. The RAB Assignment procedure shall also be terminated in the CN.
In case a request to modify or release a RAB contains the RAB ID of a RAB being queued, the RAB shall be taken out of the queue and treated according to the second request. The first request shall be responded to as a RAB failed to setup or modify with the cause value "Request superseded".
If the UTRAN failed to modify a RAB, it shall keep the RAB as it was configured prior to the modification request.
When UTRAN reports unsuccessful establishment/modification of a RAB, the cause value should be precise enough to enable the core network to know the reason for unsuccessful establishment/modification. Typical cause values are: "Requested Traffic Class not Available", "Invalid RAB Parameters Value", "Requested Maximum Bit Rate not Available", "Requested Maximum Bit Rate for DL not Available", "Requested Maximum Bit Rate for UL not Available", "Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate not Available", "Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate for DL not Available", "Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate for UL not Available", "Requested Transfer Delay not Achievable", "Invalid RAB Parameters Combination", "Condition Violation for SDU Parameters", "Condition Violation for Traffic Handling Priority", "Condition Violation for Guaranteed Bit Rate", "User Plane Versions not Supported", "Iu UP Failure", "Iu Transport Connection Failed to Establish", "TQUEUING Expiry".
If the RAB ID of a RAB requested to be released is unknown in the RNC, this shall be reported as a RAB failed to release with the cause value "Invalid RAB ID".
The RNC may indicate an impending directed retry attempt to GSM by sending a RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message with a RAB ID included in the list of RABs failed to setup and a cause value of "Directed Retry".
The RNC shall be prepared to receive a RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message containing a RABs To Be Released IE at any time and shall always reply to it. If there is an ongoing RAB Assignment procedure for a RAB indicated within the RABs To Be Released IE, the RNC shall discard the preceding RAB Assignment procedure for that specific RAB, release any related resources and report the released RAB within the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
After sending a RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message containing RAB ID within the RABs Released IE, the RNC shall be prepared to receive a new establishment request for a RAB identified by the same RAB ID.
In case SIPTO at Iu-PS functionality is supported by the UTRAN, the following applies in addition for the successful operation of the RAB Assignment procedure:
-	If the MSISDN IE is present in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, then the UTRAN may offload the RAB(s) where the Offload RAB Parameters IE is present in the RABs To Be Setup Or Modified Item IEs IE. The Access Point Name IE and the Charging Characteristics IE within the Offload RAB Parameters IE and the MSISDN IE may only be used for the SIPTO at Iu-PS function and according to the description in TS 23.060 [21].
8.2.2.1	Successful Operation for GERAN Iu-mode
For GERAN Iu-mode the following shall apply in addition for the successful operation of the RAB Assignment procedure:
-	In case of GERAN Iu-mode, for a RAB requested to be setup or modified from the CS domain, the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message may contain the GERAN BSC Container IE in order to provide GERAN-specific information to GERAN (see TS 43.051 [27]).
-	In case of GERAN Iu-mode (only for CS), if the BSC cannot provide an appropriate RAB corresponding to the content of the GERAN BSC Container IE (if received), the BSC shall report unsuccessful RAB establishment/modification indicating the cause value "GERAN Iu-mode Failure" and the GERAN Classmark IE in the GERAN Iu mode specific RABs Failed To Setup Or Modify List IE within the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
8.2.3	Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation for this Class 3 Elementary procedure is described under the Successful Operation chapter.
8.2.4	Abnormal Conditions
For a RAB requested to be modified, if only the RAB ID IE, the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE and the Transport Layer Information IE are included in the First Setup or Modify Item IE, the RAB shall not be modified, and the corresponding RAB ID IE and Cause IE shall be included in the "RABs Failed To Setup Or Modify List" in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
If, for a RAB requested to be setup towards the PS domain, any of the following IEs:
-	PDP Type Information. 
-	PDP Type Information extension.
-	Data Volume Reporting Indication.
is not present, the RNC shall continue with the procedure.
Interactions with Relocation Preparation/Enhanced Relocation procedure:
If the relocation or enhanced relocation becomes necessary during the RAB Assignment procedure, the RNC may interrupt the ongoing RAB Assignment procedure and initiate the Relocation Preparation or Enhanced Relocation procedure as follows:
1.	The RNC shall terminate the RAB Assignment procedure indicating unsuccessful RAB configuration modification:
-	for all queued RABs;
-	for RABs not already established or modified, and
-	for RABs not already released;
with the cause "Relocation triggered".
2.	The RNC shall terminate the RAB Assignment procedure indicating successful RAB configuration modification:
-	for RABs already established or modified but not yet reported to the CN, and
-	for RABs already released but not yet reported to the CN.
3.	The RNC shall report the outcome of the procedure in one RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
4.	The RNC shall either invoke relocation by sending a RELOCATION REQUIRED message to the active CN node(s) or enhanced relocation by sending the Iur ENHANCED RELOCATION REQUEST message to the target RAN node.
5.	The CN shall terminate the RAB Assignment procedure at reception of the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
Directed retry from UMTS to GSM (CS domain only):
In the case where the RNC has no RAB configuration for a particular UE in the CS domain, and the RNC receives a RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message for that UE requesting the establishment of one RAB only, a directed retry to perform inter-system handover to GSM may be initiated. In this case the RNC may interrupt the ongoing RAB Assignment procedure and initiate the Relocation Preparation procedure as follows:
1.	The RNC shall terminate the RAB Assignment procedure indicating unsuccessful RAB configuration modification of that RAB with the cause "Directed retry".
2.	The RNC shall report the outcome of the procedure in one RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
3.	The RNC shall invoke relocation by sending a RELOCATION REQUIRED message to the active CN node, with the cause "Directed Retry".
4.	The CN shall terminate the RAB Assignment procedure at reception of the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
For a RAB setup or modification, if the Supported Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) is present in the RAB Parameters IE, the RNC shall ignore the corresponding bitrate and/or extended bitrate definition in this IE.
For a RAB setup or modification, if the Supported Alternative Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) is present in the Alternative RAB Parameter Values IE, the RNC shall ignore the corresponding alternative bitrate and/or extended alternative bitrate definitions in this IE.
For a RAB setup or modification, if both the Correlation ID IE and the SIPTO Correlation ID IE are present for the same RAB, the RNC shall consider the establishment of the corresponding RAB as failed.
8.3	RAB Release Request
8.3.1	General
The purpose of the RAB Release Request procedure is to enable the UTRAN to request the release of one or several radio access bearers. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 2: RAB Release Request procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by generating a RAB RELEASE REQUEST message towards the CN. The RABs To Be Released IE shall indicate the list of RABs requested to release and the Cause IE associated to each RAB shall indicate the reason for the release, e.g. "RAB pre-empted", "Release due to UTRAN Generated Reason", "Radio Connection With UE Lost".
The RNC shall indicate the Cause IE set to "GTP Resources Unavailable" for the reasons specified in TS 23.007 [53].
Upon reception of the RAB RELEASE REQUEST message, the CN should normally initiate the appropriate release procedure for the RABs identified in the RAB RELEASE REQUEST message as defined below. It is up to the CN to decide how to react to the request.
Interaction with Iu Release Command:
If no RABs will remain according to the RAB RELEASE REQUEST message, the CN should initiate the Iu Release procedure if it does not want to keep the Iu signalling connection. The cause value to use is "No Remaining RAB".
Interaction with RAB Assignment (release RAB):
If the CN decides to release some or all indicated RABs, the CN should invoke the RAB Assignment procedure (release RAB) to this effect.
8.3.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.4	Iu Release Request
8.4.1	General
The purpose of the Iu Release Request procedure is to enable the UTRAN to request the CN to release the Iu connection for a particular UE due to some UTRAN generated reason (e.g. "O&M Intervention", "Unspecified Failure", "User Inactivity", "Repeated Integrity Checking Failure" , "Release due to UE generated signalling connection release", "Radio Connection With UE Lost", "Access Restricted Due to Shared Networks"). The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.4.2	Successful Operation

Figure 3: Iu Release Request procedure. Successful operation.
The RNS controlling the Iu connection(s) of that particular UE initiates the procedure by generating an IU RELEASE REQUEST message towards the affected CN domain(s). The procedure may be initiated for instance when the contact with a particular UE is lost or due to user inactivity.
The IU RELEASE REQUEST message shall indicate the appropriate cause value for the requested Iu connection release. It is up to the CN to decide how to react to the request.
Interactions with Iu Release procedure:
The Iu Release procedure should be initiated upon reception of an IU RELEASE REQUEST message when the cause is different than "User Inactivity". When the cause is set to "User Inactivity", it is optional to initiate the Iu Release procedure.
8.4.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.5	Iu Release
8.5.1	General
The purpose of the Iu Release procedure is to enable the CN to release an Iu connection for a particular UE and all UTRAN resources related only to that Iu connection. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
The Iu Release procedure can be initiated for at least the following reasons:
-	Completion of transaction between the UE and the CN.
-	UTRAN-generated reasons, e.g. reception of an IU RELEASE REQUEST message.
-	Completion of successful relocation of SRNS.
-	Cancellation of relocation after successful completion of a Relocation Resource Allocation procedure.
-	Detection of two Iu connections in the same domain toward one UE.
The Iu release procedure should also be initiated when there is a period of Iu signalling inactivity with no existing RAB.
8.5.2	Successful Operation

Figure 4: Iu Release procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending an IU RELEASE COMMAND message to the UTRAN.
After the IU RELEASE COMMAND message has been sent, the CN shall not send further RANAP connection-oriented messages on this particular connection.
The IU RELEASE COMMAND message shall include a Cause IE indicating the reason for the release (e.g. "Successful Relocation", "Normal Release", "Release due to UTRAN Generated Reason", "Relocation Cancelled", "No Remaining RAB").
When the RNC receives the IU RELEASE COMMAND message:
1.	Clearing of the related UTRAN resources is initiated. However, the UTRAN shall not clear resources related to other Iu signalling connections the UE might have. The Iu transport bearers for RABs subject to data forwarding and other UTRAN resources used for the GTP-PDU forwarding process, are released by the RNC only when the timer TDATAfwd expires.
2.	The RNC returns any assigned Iu user plane resources to idle i.e. neither uplink user data nor downlink user data can be transferred over the Iu interface anymore. Then the RNC sends an IU RELEASE COMPLETE message to the CN. (The RNC does not need to wait for the release of UTRAN radio resources or for the transport network layer signalling to be completed before returning the IU RELEASE COMPLETE message.) When an IU RELEASE COMPLETE message is sent, the procedure is terminated in the UTRAN.
If the IU RELEASE COMMAND message included the End Of CSFB IE, the RNC may use the indication to determine which of the existing mechanisms that should be used to move the UE to E UTRAN.
If the IU RELEASE COMMAND message includes the Out Of UTRAN IE, the RNC may use the indication to determine whether to explicitly release the RRC connection.
If the IU RELEASE COMMAND message included the Last E-UTRAN PLMN Identity IE, the RNC may take this information into account when selecting the target cell or frequency and then act as defined in TS 23.272 [67].
In case the UE has been linked to Multicast Service(s) in UTRAN and the RNC receives the IU RELEASE COMMAND message from PS domain or from CS domain when no Iu signalling connection exists towards the other domain the RNC shall perform UE de-linking as described in TS 25.346 [42].
The IU RELEASE COMPLETE message shall include within the RABs Data Volume Report List IE for each RAB towards the PS domain successfully addressed and for which data volume reporting was requested during RAB establishment, the total amount of unsuccessfully transmitted DL data for the RAB since its establishment.
If the release was initiated by the UTRAN, for each RAB towards the PS domain for which the DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE and/or the UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE are (is) available, the RNC shall include the available sequence number(s) in the RABs Released Item IE (within the RAB Released List IE) in the IU RELEASE COMPLETE message.
The RAB Release Item IE shall not be present if there is no sequence number to be reported for that RAB.
Reception of an IU RELEASE COMPLETE message terminates the procedure in the CN.
Interaction with Trace:
In case of simultaneous Iu signalling connections for both CS and PS domains, if a trace session was activated by both domains, the successful release of one of the connections should not close this trace session. If the trace session was activated by only one domain and the Iu connection for this domain is successfully released, this trace session shall be stopped in UTRAN.
8.5.3	Abnormal Conditions
If the Iu Release procedure is not initiated towards the source RNC from the CN before the expiry of timer TRELOCoverall, the source RNC should initiate the Iu Release Request procedure towards the CN with a cause value "TRELOCoverall expiry".
8.6	Relocation Preparation
8.6.1	General
The purpose of the Relocation Preparation procedure is to prepare relocation of SRNS either with involving the UE or without involving the UE. The relocation procedure shall be co-ordinated over all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE in order to allow Relocation co-ordination in the target RNC. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
The source RNC shall not initiate the Relocation Preparation procedure for an Iu signalling connection if a Prepared Relocation exists in the RNC for that Iu signalling connection or if a Relocation Preparation procedure is ongoing for that Iu signalling connection or in the case of a MOCN configuration if the Rerouting Function is ongoing.
8.6.2	Successful Operation

Figure 5: Relocation Preparation procedure. Successful operation.
The source RNC initiates the procedure by sending a RELOCATION REQUIRED message. The source RNC shall decide whether to initiate an intra-system Relocation or an inter-system handover.
The source RNC shall indicate the appropriate cause value for the Relocation in the Cause IE. Typical cause values are "Time critical Relocation", "Resource optimisation relocation", "Relocation desirable for radio reasons" , "Directed Retry", "Reduce Load in Serving Cell", "Access Restricted Due to Shared Networks", "No Iu CS UP relocation".
The source RNC shall determine whether the relocation of SRNS shall be executed with or without involvement of the UE. The source RNC shall set accordingly the Relocation Type IE to "UE involved in relocation of SRNS" or "UE not involved in relocation of SRNS".
In case of intra-system Relocation, the source RNC:
-	shall indicate in the Source ID IE the RNC-ID of the source RNC and in the Target ID IE the RNC-ID of the target RNC only including the RAC if the message is sent towards the PS domain;
-	shall in case SRVCC is performed include the SRVCC HO Indication IE in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message. The value of SRVCC HO Indication IE shall be set by the source RNC. In case the source RNC decides to involve at the target side only CS domain, the SRVCC HO Indication IE shall be set to "CS only", to "PS and CS" in case CS and PS domain at the target side shall be involved;
NOTE:	The Number of Iu Instances IE within the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE shall be set according to the SRVCC HO Indication IE.
-	shall include in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message the Source to Target Transparent Container IE. This container shall be encoded according to the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE definition. The Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE shall include:
-	the Relocation Type IE and the Number of Iu Instances IE containing the number of Iu signalling connections existing for the UE.
-	the Integrity Protection Key IE from the last received domain on which the Security Mode Control procedure has been successfully performed, and the associated Chosen Integrity Protection Algorithm IE that has been selected for this domain.
-	the Ciphering Key IE for the signalling data from the last received domain on which the Security Mode Control procedure has been successfully performed if the ciphering has been started, together with the associated Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE that has been selected for this domain. If the ciphering has not been started, the RNC may include the Ciphering Key IE and the Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE if they are available.
-	for each domain where the Security Mode Control procedure has been successfully performed in the source RNC, the Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE of CS (PS respectively) user data corresponding to the ciphering alternative that has been selected for this domain. If the Security Mode Control procedure had not been successful or performed for one domain or had proposed no ciphering alternative, the Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE for the user data of this domain shall not be included. When both the CS and the PS user data Chosen Encryption Algorithm IEs are provided, they shall be the same.
-	the RRC Container IE. If the Relocation Type IE is set to "UE not involved in relocation of SRNS" and the UE is using DCH(s), DSCH(s), USCH(s), HS-DSCH and/or E-DCH, the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE shall:
-	for each RAB include the RAB ID, the CN Domain Indicator IE and the mapping between each RAB subflow and transport channel identifier(s) over Iur, i.e. if the RAB is carried on a DCH(s), the DCH ID(s) shall be included, and when it is carried on DSCH(s), USCH(s), HS-DSCH and/or E-DCH, the DSCH ID(s), USCH ID(s), HS-DSCH MAC-d Flow ID and/or E-DCH MAC-d Flow ID respectively shall be included.
-	only in the case the active SRBs in SRNC are not all mapped onto the same DCH, include the SRB TrCH Mapping IE containing for each SRB the SRB ID and the associated transport channel identifier over Iur, i.e. if the SRB is carried on a DCH, the DCH ID shall be included, and when it is carried on DSCH, USCH, HS-DSCH and/or E-DCH, the DSCH ID, USCH ID,HS-DSCH MAC-d Flow ID and/or E-DCH MAC-d Flow ID respectively shall be included.
-	the d-RNTI IE, if the Relocation Type IE is set to "UE not involved in relocation of SRNS".
-	the Target Cell ID IE, if the Relocation Type IE is set to "UE involved in relocation of SRNS".
-	in the PS RAB To Be Replaced IE the RAB ID of the voice RAB which is relocated from the PS to the CS CN domain, in case SRVCC is performed.
-	the d-RNTI for No IuCS UP IE, if the source RNC doesn't have an Iu-CS user plane connection, the Relocation Type IE is set to "UE involved in relocation of SRNS" and the reason for the relocation is the source RNC cannot support CS service. The Cause IE shall be set as "No Iu CS UP relocation" in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message.
-	the MBMS Linking Information IE, if available, in case the UE has been linked to at least one Multicast Service.
-	the UE History Information IE and the source RNC shall add the stored information to the Last Visited Cell List IE, in case the source RNC is configured to collect UE history information.
-	the Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority IE if available in the source RNC.
-	the Management Based MDT Allowed IE only or the Management Based MDT Allowed IE and the Management Based MDT PLMN List IE, if this has been provided to the RNC and the serving PLMN of the relocation target is included in the Management Based MDT PLMN List.
-	the Last E-UTRAN PLMN Identity IE if available in the source RNC.
-	may in case a Trace Recording Session is active in the Source RNC due to a Signalling Based Activation (see TS 32.421 [37]), include the Trace Recording Session Information IE containing information identifying the Trace Record being generated in the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE. 
-	may in case a QoE function is active in the Source RNC (see TS 25.300 [72]), include the UE Application layer measurement configuration for relocation IE.
In case of inter-system handover to GSM CS domain, the RNC:
-	the source RNC shall indicate in the Source ID IE the Service Area Identifier and in the Target ID IE the cell global identity of the cell in the target system;
-	shall include the MS Classmark 2 and MS Classmark 3 IEs received from the UE in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message to the CN;
-	shall include the Old BSS to New BSS Information IE within the RELOCATION REQUIRED message only if the information is available. This information shall include, if available, the current traffic load in the source cell, i.e. prior to the inter-system handover attempt. This information shall also include the source cell identifier the included traffic load values correspond to. In the case the UE is using, prior to the inter-system handover attempt, radio resources of more than one cell, it is implementation specific for which cell the source RNC should report the current traffic load and the cell identifier.
-	shall in case SRVCC is performed include the SRVCC HO Indication IE in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message. The value of SRVCC HO Indication IE shall be set to "CS only" by the source RNC;
In case of inter-system handover to GSM PS domain, the RNC:
-	shall indicate in the Source ID IE the Service Area Identifier, in the Target ID IE the cell global identity of the cell in the target system and shall also indicate routing area code for the relevant cell in the target system;
-	shall include the Source BSS to Target BSS Transparent Container IE within the RELOCATION REQUIRED message to the CN. It may indicate in this container whether it requests to receive the SI/PSI container from the external inter-system handover target in the RELOCATION COMMAND message.
In case of inter-system handover towards the GSM CS domain and GSM PS domain in parallel, the source RNC:
-	shall include in the Target ID IE the same cell global identity of the cell in the target system for CS domain and PS domain and set the appropriate information about the nature of the CS/PS inter-system handover (see TS 43.055 [47]) in the Old BSS to New BSS Information IE and Source BSS to Target BSS Transparent Container IE accordingly.
-	shall in case SRVCC is performed include the SRVCC HO Indication IE in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message. The value of SRVCC HO Indication IE shall be set to "PS and CS" by the source RNC;
In case of inter-system handover to E-UTRAN (as specified in TS 23.401 [48]), the RNC:
-	shall indicate in the Source ID IE the RNC-ID of the source RNC and in the Target ID IE either the eNB-ID or the Corresponding RNC-ID of the target eNodeB in the target system (see subclause 9.2.1.25);
-	shall include the Source to Target Transparent Container IE within the RELOCATION REQUIRED message. The information in the container shall be encoded according to the Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container IE definition as specified in TS 36.413 [49].
-	shall, in case rSRVCC is performed, include the rSRVCC HO Indication IE in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message. The value of rSRVCC HO Indication IE shall be set to "PS only" by the source RNC.
When the source RNC sends the RELOCATION REQUIRED message, it shall start the timer TRELOCprep.
When the preparation including resource allocation in the target system is ready and the CN has decided to continue the relocation of SRNS, the CN shall send a RELOCATION COMMAND message to the source RNC and the CN shall start the timer TRELOCcomplete.
If the CSG Id IE and no Cell Access Mode IE are received in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message, the CN shall perform the access control according to the CSG Subscription Data of that UE and if the access control is successful, or if one of the RABs has some particular ARP values (see TS 23.060 [21]), it shall continue the relocation and propagate the target CSG Id IE to the target side. If the access control is unsuccessful but at least one of the RABs has some particular ARP values (see TS 23.060 [21]) the CN shall also provide the CSG Membership Status IE set to "non-member" to the target side.
If the CSG Id IE and the Cell Access Mode IE set to "hybrid" are received in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message, the CN shall provide the CSG Membership Status IE of the UE and the target CSG Id to the target side.
If the Target To Source Transparent Container IE or the L3 information IE or the Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container IE is received by the CN from the relocation target, it shall be included in the RELOCATION COMMAND message.
The RELOCATION COMMAND message may also contain the Inter-System Information Transparent Container IE.
In case of SRVCC operation, when the target system is GERAN the RELOCATION COMMAND message shall contain the SRVCC Information IE.
In case of rSRVCC operation, the RELOCATION COMMAND message shall contain the rSRVCC Information IE.
If the Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container IE is received in the RELOCATION COMMAND message, only the value part of the UE related containers received shall be sent to the UE.
For each RAB successfully established in the target system and originating from the PS domain, the RELOCATION COMMAND message shall contain at least one pair of Iu transport address and Iu transport association to be used for the forwarding of the DL N-PDU duplicates towards the relocation target. If more than one pair of Iu transport address and Iu transport association is included, the source RNC shall select one of the pairs to be used for the forwarding of the DL N-PDU duplicates towards the relocation target. Upon reception of the RELOCATION COMMAND message from the PS domain, the source RNC shall start the timer TDATAfwd.
The Relocation Preparation procedure is terminated in the CN by transmission of the RELOCATION COMMAND message.
If the target system (including target CN) does not support all existing RABs, the RELOCATION COMMAND message shall contain a list of RABs indicating all the RABs that are not supported by the target system. This list may include information on RABs from the PS domain not existing in the source RNC which shall be ignored by the source RNC. This list is contained in the RABs to Be Released IE. The source RNC shall use this list to avoid transferring associated contexts where applicable and may use this list e.g. to decide if to cancel the relocation or not. The resources associated with not supported RABs shall not be released until the relocation is completed. This is in order to make a return to the old configuration possible in case of a failed or cancelled relocation.
Upon reception of the RELOCATION COMMAND message the source RNC shall stop the timer TRELOCprep, start the timer TRELOCOverall and terminate the Relocation Preparation procedure. The source RNC is then defined to have a Prepared Relocation for that Iu signalling connection.
When the Relocation Preparation procedure is successfully terminated and when the source RNC is ready, the source RNC should trigger the execution of relocation of SRNS.
Interactions with the SRVCC Preparation procedure:
In case of SRVCC operation, the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE shall include the Integrity Protection Key IE, the Ciphering Key IE for the signalling data and the SRVCC Information as received during the SRVCC Preparation procedure.
Interactions with the rSRVCC Preparation procedure:
In case of rSRVCC operation, the RNC shall only initate the Relocation Preparation procedure on the Iu-CS signalling connections existing for the UE.
Interactions with other procedures:
If, after a RELOCATION REQUIRED message is sent and before the Relocation Preparation procedure is terminated, the source RNC receives a RANAP message initiating another connection oriented RANAP class 1 or class 3 procedure (except IU RELEASE COMMAND message, which shall be handled normally) via the same Iu signalling connection, the source RNC shall either:
1.	cancel the Relocation Preparation procedure i.e. execute the Relocation Cancel procedure with an appropriate value for the Cause IE, e.g. "Interaction with other procedure", and after successful completion of the Relocation Cancel procedure, the source RNC shall continue the initiated RANAP procedure;
or
2.	terminate the initiated RANAP procedure without any changes in UTRAN by sending the appropriate response message with the cause value "Relocation Triggered" to the CN. The source RNC shall then continue the relocation of SRNS.
If during the Relocation Preparation procedure the source RNC receives a DIRECT TRANSFER message it shall be handled normally up to the anticipated limit according to section 14.12.4.2 TS 25.331 [10].
If during the Relocation Preparation procedure the source RNC receives connection oriented RANAP class 2 messages (with the exception of DIRECT TRANSFER message) it shall decide to either execute the procedure immediately or suspend it. In case the relocation is cancelled, the RNC shall resume any suspended procedures (if any).
After the Relocation Preparation procedure is successfully terminated, all RANAP messages (except IU RELEASE COMMAND message, which shall be handled normally) received via the same Iu signalling bearer shall be ignored by the source RNC.
8.6.2.1	Successful Operation for GERAN Iu-mode
The relocation between UTRAN and GERAN Iu-mode shall be considered in the Relocation Preparation procedure as intra-system relocation from RANAP point of view.
For GERAN Iu-mode and to support Relocation towards a GERAN BSC in Iu mode the following shall apply in addition for the successful operation of the Relocation Preparation procedure:
-	In case of a Relocation to GERAN Iu-mode (only for CS), the RNC shall include, if available, the GERAN Classmark IE within the RELOCATION REQUIRED message in those cases where the transmission of the GERAN Classmark IE is required, as defined in TS 43.051 [27].
8.6.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 6: Relocation Preparation procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the CN or target system is not able to even partially accept the relocation of SRNS, or a failure occurs during the Relocation Preparation procedure in the CN, or the CN decides not to continue the relocation of SRNS, the CN shall send a RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message to the source RNC.
The RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message shall contain the appropriate value for the Cause IE, e.g. "TRELOCalloc expiry", "Relocation Failure in Target CN/RNC or Target System", "Relocation not supported in Target RNC or Target System", "Relocation Target not allowed", "No Radio Resources Available in Target Cell" or "Traffic Load In The Target Cell Higher Than In The Source Cell".
Transmission of the RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message terminates the procedure in the CN. Reception of the RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message terminates the procedure in UTRAN.
When the Relocation Preparation procedure is unsuccessfully terminated, the existing Iu signalling connection can be used normally.
If the Relocation Preparation procedure is unsuccessfully terminated, the CN shall release the possibly existing Iu signalling connection for the same UE and related to the same relocation of SRNS towards the target RNC by initiating the Iu Release procedure towards the target RNC with an appropriate value for the Cause IE, e.g. "Relocation Cancelled".
The RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message may contain the Inter-System Information Transparent Container IE. 
If the CSG Id IE and no Cell Access Mode IE are received in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message and the access control is unsuccessful and if none of the RABs has some particular ARP values (see TS 23.060 [21]), the CN shall send the RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value to the source RNC. Upon reception, the source RNC may decide to prevent relocation for that UE towards CSG cells with corresponding CSG Id.
Interactions with Relocation Cancel procedure:
If there is no response from the CN to the RELOCATION REQUIRED message before timer TRELOCprep expires in the source RNC, the source RNC shall cancel the Relocation Preparation procedure by initiating the Relocation Cancel procedure with the appropriate value for the Cause IE, e.g. "TRELOCprep expiry".
8.6.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the target RNC indicated in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message is not known to the CN:
1.	The CN shall reject the relocation of SRNS by sending a RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message to the source RNC with Cause IE set to "Unknown target RNC".
2.	The CN shall continue to use the existing Iu connection towards the source RNC.
NOTE: 	In case two CN domains are involved in the SRNS Relocation Preparation procedure and the Source RNC receives the Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container IE via two CN domains, it may check whether the content of the two Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container IE is the same. In case the Source RNC receives two different Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container IEs, the RNC behaviour is left implementation-specific.
NOTE: 	In case two CN domains are involved in the SRNS Relocation Preparation procedure due to the inter-system handover towards the GSM CS domain and GSM PS domain in parallel and the Source RNC receives the L3 Information IE from CS domain and the Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container IE from PS domain, it may check whether the content of the L3 Information IE and the content of the Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container IE is the same. In case the Source RNC receives two IEs with different contents, the RNC behaviour is left implementation-specific.
8.6.5	Co-ordination of Two Iu Signalling Connections
If the RNC decides to initiate the Relocation Preparation procedure for a UTRAN to UTRAN relocation, the RNC shall initiate simultaneously a Relocation Preparation procedure on all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE. The source RNC shall also include the same Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, Relocation Type IE, Source ID IE and Cause IE in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message towards the two domains.
For intersystem handover to GSM, the Relocation Preparation procedure shall be initiated either only towards the circuit-switched CN or only towards the packet-switched CN, if the inter-system handover towards the GSM CS domain and GSM PS domain in parallel is not supported. Otherwise the Relocation Preparation procedure shall be simultaneously initiated towards both the circuit-switched CN and the packet-swithched CN.
The source RNC shall not trigger the execution of relocation of SRNS unless it has received a RELOCATION COMMAND message from all Iu signalling connections for which the Relocation Preparation procedure has been initiated, except for the case where there is at least one of the RABs that has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.060 [21]).
If the source RNC receives a RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message from the CN, the RNC shall initiate the Relocation Cancel procedure on the other Iu signalling connection for the UE if the other Iu signalling connection exists and if the Relocation Preparation procedure is still ongoing or the procedure has terminated successfully in that Iu signalling connection, except for the case where there is at least one of the RABs that has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.060 [21]) in the other domain.
8.7	Relocation Resource Allocation
8.7.1	General
The purpose of the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure is to allocate resources from a target RNS for a relocation of SRNS. The procedure shall be co-ordinated over all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
NOTE:	In case of SRVCC operation, the procedure shall be co-ordinated in the domains which the source RNC decides to involve in the SRVCC operation.
8.7.2	Successful Operation

Figure 7: Relocation Resource Allocation procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by generating a RELOCATION REQUEST message. In a UTRAN to UTRAN relocation, the message shall contain the information (if any) required by the UTRAN to build at least the same set of RABs as existing for the UE before the relocation, except the relocation due to SRVCC operation. The CN may indicate that RAB QoS negotiation is allowed for certain RAB parameters and in some cases also which alternative values to be used in the negotiation.
The RELOCATION REQUEST message may also include an alternative RAB configuration for a RAB specified in the Alternative RAB configuration IE in the Alternative RAB Parameter Values IE. If Alternative RAB configuration IE for a RAB is included in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC is allowed after the successful relocation to request the CN to trigger the execution of this alternative RAB configuration. No negotiation is allowed during the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure between the requested RAB configuration and this alternative RAB configuration.
When the CN transmits the RELOCATION REQUEST message, it shall start the timer TRELOCalloc.
When a RELOCATION REQUEST message is sent from a CN node towards an RNC for which the sending CN node is not the default CN node, the Global CN-ID IE shall be included.
Upon reception of the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall initiate allocation of requested resources.
The RELOCATION REQUEST message shall contain the following IEs:
-	Permanent NAS UE Identity IE (if available);
-	Cause IE;
-	CN Domain Indicator IE;
-	Source RNC To Target RNC Transparent Container IE;
-	Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IE;
-	Integrity Protection Information IE (if available);
-	SNA Access Information IE (if available);
-	UESBI-Iu IE (if available);
-	Selected PLMN identity IE if in MOCN or GWCN configuration;
-	CN MBMS Linking Information IE (if available);
-	UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE (if available);
-	Anchor PLMN Identity IE (if available).
For each RAB requested to relocate (or to be created e.g. in the case of inter-system handover), the message shall contain the following IEs:
-	RAB-ID IE;
-	NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE (if the relevant NAS information is provided by the CN);
-	RAB parameters IE;
-	User Plane Information IE;
-	Transport Layer Address IE;
-	Iu Transport Association IE;
-	Data Volume Reporting Indication IE (only for PS);
-	PDP Type Information IE (only for PS).
The RELOCATION REQUEST message may include the following IE:
-	Encryption Information IE (shall not be included if the Integrity Protection Information IE is not included);
-	CSG Membership Status IE (shall be included in cases of relocation of CSG capable UEs to hybrid cells);
	PDP Type Information extension IE (may be included if PDP Type Information IE is included).
For each RAB requested to relocate the message may include the following IEs:
-	Service Handover IE;
-	Alternative RAB Parameter Values IE;
-	E-UTRAN Service Handover IE.
The following information elements received in RELOCATION REQUEST message require the same special actions in the RNC as specified for the same IEs in the RAB Assignment procedure:
-	RAB-ID IE;
-	User plane Information IE (i.e. required User Plane Mode and required User Plane Versions);
-	Priority level IE, Pre-emption Capability IE and Pre-emption Vulnerability IE;
-	Service Handover IE;
-	E-UTRAN Service Handover IE.
The SDU Format Information Parameter IE in the RAB Parameters IE shall be present only if the User Plane Mode IE is set to "support mode for pre-defined SDU sizes" and the Traffic Class IE is set to either "Conversational" or "Streaming".
For a RAB setup, the RAB Parameters IE may contain the Signalling Indication IE. The Signalling Indication IE shall not be present if the Traffic Class IE is not set to "Interactive" or if the CN Domain Indicator IE is not set to "PS domain".
If the RELOCATION REQUEST message includes the Permanent NAS UE identity (i.e. IMSI), the RNC shall associate the permanent identity to the RRC Connection of that user and shall save it for the duration of the RRC connection.
If the RELOCATION REQUEST message includes the PDP Type Information IE or PDP Type Information extension IE, the UTRAN may use this IE to configure any compression algorithms.
If the CSG Id IE is received in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the UTRAN shall validate it by comparing it with the CSG ID broadcast by the target cell. If it is valid and if the CSG Membership Status IE is received set to "member", the target RNC may apply appropriate handling to the UE. 
If the CSG Membership Status IE and the CSG Id IE are received in the RELOCATION REQUEST message and the CSG Id does not correspond to the CSG Id broadcast by the target cell, the RNC may provide the QoS to the UE as for a non member and shall send back in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the actual CSG Id broadcast by the target cell.
If the target RNC receives the CSG Id IE and the CSG Membership Status IE is set to "non-member" in the RELOCATION REQUEST message and the target cell is a CSG cell and at least one of the RABs has some particular ARP values (see TS 23.060 [21]) the RNC shall send back the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE to the CN accepting those RABs and failing the other RABs,
The Cause IE shall contain the same value as the one received in the related RELOCATION REQUIRED message.
The Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IE contains an Iu signalling connection identifier which is allocated by the CN. The value for the Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IE shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify an Iu signalling connection for the involved CN node. The RNC shall store and remember this identifier for the duration of the Iu connection.
The RNC shall, if supported, use the UESBI-Iu IE when included in the RELOCATION REQUEST message. If UESBI-Iu IE contains an IMEISV the RNC may use this information to determine the characteristics of the UE for subsequent handling.
If the CN MBMS Linking Information IE is included in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the RNC shall, if supported, use the CN MBMS Linking Information IE to perform suitable UE linking as described in TS 25.346 [42].
The algorithms within the Integrity Protection Information IE and the Encryption Information IE shall be ordered in preferred order with the most preferred first in the list.
The Permitted Encryption Algorithms IE within the Encryption Information IE may contain "no encryption" within an element of its list in order to allow the RNC not to cipher the respective connection. This can be done either by not starting ciphering or by using the UEA0 algorithm. In the absence of the Encryption Information IE, the RNC shall not start ciphering.
The Source To Target Transparent Container IE is encoded as the Source RNC To Target RNC Transparent Container IE. The following applies for the Source RNC To Target RNC Transparent Container IE:
-	In case of intra-system relocation, if no Integrity Protection Key IE (Ciphering Key IE respectively) is provided within the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the target RNC shall not start integrity protection (ciphering respectively).
-	In case of intra-system relocation, when an Ciphering Key IE is provided within the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the target RNC may select to use a ciphering alternative where an algorithm is used. It shall in this case make use of this key to cipher its signalling data whatever the selected algorithm. The Encryption Key IE that is contained within the Encryption Information IE of the RELOCATION REQUEST message shall never be considered for ciphering of signalling data.
-	In case of intra-system relocation, when an Integrity Protection Key IE is provided within the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the target RNC shall select one integrity algorithm to start integrity and shall in this case make use of this key whatever the selected algorithm. The integrity protection key that is contained within the Integrity Protection Information IE of the RELOCATION REQUEST message shall never be considered.
-	In case of intra-system relocation, when a Trace Recording Session Information IE is provided within the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the Target RNC should store that information to include it in a potential future Trace Record for that UE.
-	If the Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority IE is contained in the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the target RNC shall store the received Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority and use it as defined in TS 36.300 [52]. 
-	If the CSFB Information IE is contained in the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the target RNC may apply special treatment.
-	The RELOCATION REQUEST message may contain the Cell Load Group Information IE in the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE.
-	If the Management Based MDT Allowed IE only or the Management Based MDT Allowed IE and the Management Based MDT PLMN List IE, is contained in the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the target RNC shall use it, if supported, to allow subsequent selection of the UE for management based MDT as defined in TS 32.422 [38].
-	If the Last E-UTRAN PLMN Identity IE is contained in the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the target RNC may store the received last E-UTRAN PLMN Identity and use it as defined in TS 23.272 [67].
-	If the SRVCC Source IE is contained in the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the target RNC may store and consider that the SRVCC is from 5G to 3G.
In case of inter-system relocation, the integrity protection and ciphering information to be considered shall be the ones received in the Integrity Protection Information IE and Encryption Information IE of the RELOCATION REQUEST message.
The Global CN-ID IE contains the identity of the CN node that sent the RELOCATION REQUEST message, and it shall, if included, be stored together with the Iu signalling connection identifier. If the Global CN-ID IE is not included, the RELOCATION REQUEST message shall be considered as coming from the default CN node for the indicated CN domain.
The following additional actions shall be executed in the target RNC during the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure:
If included in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the Target to Source Transparent Container IE shall be encoded as the Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container IE.
If the Relocation Type IE is set to "UE involved in relocation of SRNS":
-	except the relocation due to SRVCC operation, the target RNC should not accept a requested RAB if the RAB did not exist in the source RNC before the relocation. In case of SRVCC operation, the target RNC may accept CS RAB even if it did not exist in the source RNC before the relocation.
-	The target RNC may accept a requested RAB only if the RAB can be supported by the target RNC.
-	Other RABs shall be rejected by the target RNC in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message with an appropriate value in the Cause IE, e.g. "Unable to Establish During Relocation".
-	The target RNC shall include information adapted to the resulting RAB configuration in the target to source RNC transparent container to be included in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message sent to the CN. If the target RNC supports triggering of the Relocation Detect procedure via the Iur interface, the RNC shall assign a d-RNTI for the context of the relocation and include it in the container. If two CNs are involved in the relocation of SRNS, the target RNC may, however, decide to send the container to only one CN.
-	If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used when allocating the resources, these RAB parameter values shall be included in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message within the Assigned RAB Parameter Values IE.
-	If d-RNTI for No IuCS UP IE is contained in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall use this information to configure the resource for the UE over Iur during the relocation.
If the Relocation Type IE is set to "UE not involved in relocation of SRNS":
-	The target RNC shall not accept a requested RAB if the RAB did not exist in the source RNC before the relocation.
-	The target RNC may accept a RAB only if the radio bearer(s) for the RAB either exist(s) already and can be used for the RAB by the target RNC, or do(es) not exist before the relocation but can be established in order to support the RAB in the target RNC.
-	If existing radio bearers are not related to any RAB that is accepted by the target RNC, the radio bearers shall be ignored during the relocation of SRNS and the radio bearers shall be released by the radio interface protocols after completion of relocation of SRNS.
-	If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used when allocating the resources, these RAB parameter values shall be included in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message within the Assigned RAB Parameter Values IE. It should be noted that the usage of alternative RAB parameter values is not applicable to the UTRAN initiated relocation of type "UE not involved in relocation of SRNS".
If the UE History Information IE is included in the RELOCATION REQUEST message and the target RNC is configured to collect the information, the target RNC shall, if supported, collect information defined in the UE History Information IE.
The target RNC shall, if supported, include the UE Application layer measurement configuration supported in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message sent to the CN. It sets the bitmap to indicate its support for the measureemnt(s) indicated in the UE Application layer measurement configuration for relocation.
After all necessary resources for accepted RABs including the initialised Iu user plane, are successfully allocated, the target RNC shall send a RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the CN.
For each RAB successfully setup the RNC shall include the following IEs:
-	RAB ID
-	Transport Layer Address (when no ALCAP has been used)
-	Iu Transport Association (when no ALCAP has been used)
Two pairs of Transport Layer Address IE and Iu Transport Association IE may be included for RABs established towards the PS domain.
For each RAB the RNC is not able to setup during the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure, the RNC shall include the RAB ID IE and the Cause IE within the RABs Failed To Setup IE. The resources associated with the RABs indicated as failed to set up shall not be released in the CN until the relocation is completed. This is in order to make a return to the old configuration possible in case of a failed or cancelled relocation.
The RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message sent to the CN shall, if applicable and if not sent via the other CN domain, include the Target RNC To Source RNC Transparent Container IE. This container shall be transferred by the CN to the source RNC or the external relocation source while completing the Relocation Preparation procedure.
If the target RNC supports cell load-based inter-system handover, then in the case of inter-system handover, the New BSS to Old BSS Information IE may be included in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message. This information shall include, if available, the current traffic load in the target cell assuming a successful completion of the handover in progress.
In case of inter-system relocation, the RNC shall include the Chosen Integrity Protection Algorithm IE (Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE respectively) within the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, if, and only if the Integrity Protection Information IE (Encryption Information IE respectively) was included in the RELOCATION REQUEST message.
In case of intra-system relocation, the RNC shall include the Chosen Integrity Protection Algorithm IE (Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE respectively) within the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, if, and only if the Integrity Protection Key IE (Ciphering Key IE respectively) was included within the Source RNC-to-Target RNC transparent container IE.
If one or more of the RABs that the target RNC has decided to support cannot be supported by the CN, then these failed RABs shall not be released towards the target RNC until the relocation is completed.
If the NAS Synchronisation Indicator IE is contained in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall pass it to the UE.
If the SNA Access Information IE is contained in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall store this information and use it to determine whether the UE has access to radio resources in the UTRAN. The target RNC shall consider that the UE is authorised to access only the PLMNs identified by the PLMN identity IE in the SNA Access Information IE. If the Authorised SNAs IE is included for a given PLMN (identified by the PLMN identity IE), then the target RNC shall consider that the access to radio resources for the concerned UE is restricted to the LAs contained in the SNAs identified by the SNAC IEs.
If the SNA Access Information IE is not contained in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall consider that no access restriction applies to the UE in the UTRAN.
Transmission and reception of a RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
Before reporting the successful outcome of the Relocation Resource allocation procedure, the RNC shall have executed the initialisation of the user plane mode as requested by the CN in the User Plane Mode IE. If the RNC cannot initialise the requested user plane mode for any of the user plane mode versions in the UP Mode Versions IE according to the rules for initialisation of the respective user plane mode versions, as described in TS 25.415 [6], the RAB Relocation shall fail with the cause value "RNC unable to establish all RFCs".
If the Selected PLMN identity IE is contained in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall use this information to send it to the UE.
If the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is included in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the UTRAN shall, if supported, store the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate data rate of non-GBR traffic for this UE.
In case SIPTO at Iu-PS functionality is supported by the UTRAN, the following applies in addition for the successful operation of the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure:
-	If the MSISDN IE is present in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, then the UTRAN may offload the RAB(s) where the Offload RAB Parameters IE is present in the RABs To Be Setup Item IEs IE. The Access Point Name IE and the Charging Characteristics IE within the Offload RAB Parameters IE and the MSISDN IE may only be used for the SIPTO at Iu-PS function and according to the description in TS 23.060 [21].
If the Power Saving Indicator IE is included in the RELOCATION REQUEST message the RNC shall if supported, store this information and use it when determining to send the UE back to the PSM mode if the value is "PSM Configured" or to send the UE back to the eDRX mode in Idle if the value is "eDRX Configured", as defined in TS 23.682 [68].

If the UE Application layer measurement configuration for relocation IE is included in the RELOCATION REQUEST message the RNC shall if supported, store this information and use it for QoE function (see TS 25.300 [72]).
Interactions with Uplink Information Exchange procedure:
In case of UTRAN to UTRAN CS only relocation, if the RELOCATION REQUEST message includes the MBMS Linking Information IE in the Source RNC To Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the RNC shall, if supported, initiate the Uplink Information Exchange procedure to retrieve the Multicast Service list for the UE, create relevant MBMS Service Context, store this information and perform the relevant UE linking as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
8.7.2.1	Successful Operation for GERAN Iu-mode
The relocation between UTRAN and GERAN Iu-mode shall be considered in the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure as intra-system relocation from RANAP point of view.
For GERAN Iu-mode and to support Relocation towards a GERAN BSC in Iu mode the following shall apply in addition for the successful operation of the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure:
-	In case of GERAN Iu-mode, for RAB requested to be relocated from the CS domain, the RELOCATION REQUEST message may contain the GERAN BSC Container IE in order to provide GERAN specific information to the target BSC (see TS 43.051 [27]).
8.7.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8: Relocation Resource Allocation procedure: Unsuccessful operation.
If the target RNC cannot even partially accept the relocation of SRNS or a failure occurs during the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure in the target RNC, the target RNC shall send a RELOCATION FAILURE message to the CN. The RELOCATION FAILURE message shall contain the Cause IE with an appropriate value.
If the target RNC cannot support any of the integrity protection (ciphering respectively) alternatives provided in the Integrity Protection Information IE or Encryption Information IE, it shall return a RELOCATION FAILURE message with the cause "Requested Ciphering and/or Integrity Protection algorithms not supported".
If the target RNC cannot support the relocation due to PUESBINE feature, it shall return a RELOCATION FAILURE message with the cause "Incoming Relocation Not Supported Due To PUESBINE Feature".
If the target RNC does not receive the CSG Membership Status IE but does receive the CSG Id IE in the RELOCATION REQUEST message and the CSG Id IE is not valid, it shall send the RELOCATION FAILURE message to the CN with an appropriate cause value.
If the CSG Id IE is not received in the RELOCATION REQUEST message and the access control for the relocation to a CSG cell is unsuccessful and if none of the RABs has some particular ARP values (see TS 23.060 [21]), the target RNC shall return a RELOCATION FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value, e.g. "Relocation Target not allowed".
Transmission and reception of a RELOCATION FAILURE message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
When the CN receives a RELOCATION FAILURE message from the target RNC, it shall stop timer TRELOCalloc and shall assume possibly allocated resources within the target RNC completely released.
In case of inter-system handover, and if the target RNC supports cell load-based inter-system handover, then
-	the NewBSS to Old BSS Information IE may be included in the RELOCATION FAILURE message. This information shall include, if available, the current traffic load in the target cell.
-	the RELOCATION FAILURE message shall contain the Cause IE with an appropriate value, e.g. "No Radio Resources Available in Target Cell" or "Traffic Load In The Target Cell Higher Than In The Source Cell".
-	If the Cause IE received in the RELOCATION REQUEST message contains the value "Reduce Load in Serving Cell" and the load in the target cell is greater than in the source cell then, if the target cell is not in a congested or blocked state, the RNC shall return a RELOCATION FAILURE message which may include the cause "Traffic Load In The Target Cell Higher Than In The Source Cell".
-	When the RNC returns a RELOCATION FAILURE message with the cause "Traffic Load In The Target Cell Higher Than In The Source Cell", it shall also include the NewBSS to Old BSS Information IE. This information shall include the current traffic load in the target cell.
8.7.3.1	Unsuccessful Operation for GERAN Iu-mode
For GERAN Iu-mode and to support Relocation towards a GERAN BSC in Iu mode the following shall apply in addition for the unsuccessful operation of the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure:
-	In case a Relocation to GERAN Iu-mode fails (only for CS), because the Target BSC cannot provide an appropriate RAB corresponding to the content of the GERAN BSC Container IE (if received), the Target BSC shall report the unsuccessful Relocation Resource Allocation by indicating the cause value "GERAN Iu-mode Failure" within the RELOCATION FAILURE message and shall include the GERAN Classmark IE.
8.7.4	Abnormal Conditions
If after reception of the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC receives another RELOCATION REQUEST message on the same Iu connection, then the target RNC shall discard the latter message and the original Relocation Resource Allocation procedure shall continue normally.
If the target RNC receives a Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE containing Chosen Integrity Protection (Encryption respectively) Algorithm IE without Integrity Protection (Ciphering respectively) Key IE, it shall return a RELOCATION FAILURE message with the cause "Conflict with already existing Integrity protection and/or Ciphering information".
Interactions with Iu Release procedure:
If the CN decides to not continue the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure (e.g. due to TRELOCalloc expiry) before the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure is completed, the CN shall stop timer TRELOCalloc (if timer TRELOCalloc has not already expired) and the CN shall, if the Iu signalling connection has been established or later becomes established, initiate the Iu Release procedure towards the target RNC with an appropriate value for the Cause IE, e.g. "Relocation Cancelled".
NOTE: 	In case two CN domains are involved in the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure, the target RNC may check whether the content of the two Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IEs or the two SNA Access Information IEs is the same. In case the target RNC receives two different Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IEs or two different SNA Access Information IEs, the RNC behaviour is left implementation specific.
8.7.5	Co-ordination of Two Iu Signalling Connections
Co-ordination of two Iu signalling connections during Relocation Resource Allocation procedure shall be executed by the target RNC when the Number of Iu Instances IE received in the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE in the RELOCATION REQUEST message indicates that two CN domains are involved in relocation of SRNS.
When both the CS and PS user data Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE are received within the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE and if these two received Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE are not the same, the target RNC shall fail the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure by sending back a RELOCATION FAILURE message.
The integrity protection (ciphering respectively) alternatives provided in the Integrity Protection Information IE (Encryption Information IE respectively) of the RELOCATION REQUEST messages received from both CN domains shall have at least one common alternative, otherwise the Relocation Resource Allocation shall be failed by sending back a RELOCATION FAILURE message.
If two CN domains are involved, the following actions shall be taken by the target RNC:
-	The target RNC shall utilise the Permanent NAS UE Identity IE, received explicitly from each CN domain within the RELOCATION REQUEST messages, to co-ordinate both Iu signalling connections.
-	The target RNC shall generate and send RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE messages only after all expected RELOCATION REQUEST messages are received and analysed, except for the case where there is at least one of the RABs that has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.060 [21]).
-	In case the SRVCC operation is performed and the source system is E-UTRAN, the target RNC shall generate and send RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the CN in CS domain if the relocation of SRNS is accepted for the CS domain but not accepted for the PS domain.
-	If the relocation is to a target CSG cell where the UE is a non-member of the target CSG, and where there is at least one of the RABs that has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.060 [21]) in one domain, the target RNC shall accept those RABs with a particular ARP value (see TS 23.060 [21]) and fail the other RABs, and send RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE messages without waiting for the RELOCATION REQUEST message in the other domain.
-	If the target RNC decides to send the Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container IE via the two CN domains, the target RNC shall ensure that the same Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container IE is included in RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE messages transmitted via the two CN domains and related to the same relocation of SRNS.
If the target RNC receives the UESBI-Iu IE on the Iu-CS but not on the Iu-PS interface (or vice versa), the RNC shall, if supported, use the UESBI-Iu IE for both domains.
8.8	Relocation Detect
8.8.1	General
The purpose of the Relocation Detect procedure is to indicate to the CN the detection by the RNC of an SRNS relocation execution. The procedure shall be co-ordinated over all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE. The procedure uses connection-oriented signalling.
8.8.2	Successful Operation

Figure 9: Relocation Detect procedure: Successful operation.
The target RNC shall send a RELOCATION DETECT message to the CN when a relocation execution trigger is received.
If the type of relocation of SRNS is "UE involved in relocation of SRNS", the relocation execution trigger may be received either from the Uu interface or as an implementation option from the Iur interface. If the type of relocation of SRNS is "UE not involved in relocation of SRNS", the relocation execution trigger is received from the Iur interface.
When the RELOCATION DETECT message is sent, the target RNC shall start SRNC operation.
Upon reception of the RELOCATION DETECT message, the CN may switch the user plane from the source RNC to the target RNC.
8.8.3	Abnormal Conditions
Interactions with Relocation Complete procedure:
If the RELOCATION COMPLETE message is received by the CN before the reception of the RELOCATION DETECT message, the CN shall handle the RELOCATION COMPLETE message normally.
8.8.4	Co-ordination of Two Iu Signalling Connections
When the Relocation Detect procedure is to be initiated by the target RNC, the target RNC shall initiate the Relocation Detect procedure on all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE between the target RNC and the CN.
8.9	Relocation Complete
8.9.1	General
The purpose of the Relocation Complete procedure is to indicate to the CN the completion by the target RNC of the relocation of SRNS. The procedure shall be co-ordinated over all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE. The procedure uses connection-oriented signalling.
8.9.2	Successful Operation

Figure 10: Relocation Complete procedure. Successful operation.
When the new SRNC-ID and serving RNC Radio Network Temporary Identity are successfully exchanged with the UE by the radio protocols, the target RNC shall initiate the Relocation Complete procedure by sending a RELOCATION COMPLETE message to the CN. Upon reception of the RELOCATION COMPLETE message, the CN should stop the TRELOCcomplete timer.
If the Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag IE is included in the RELOCATION COMPLETE message then the CN shall, if supported, use the IE as described in TS 23.060 [21].
If the Tunnel Information for BBF IE is received in the RELOCATION COMPLETE message, the CN shall, if supported, use the IE as described in TS 23.139 [65].
If the LHN ID IE is included in the RELOCATION COMPLETE message, the CN shall, if supported, use it as specified in TS 23.060 [21].
8.9.3	Abnormal Conditions
If the timer TRELOCcomplete expires:
-	The CN should initiate release of Iu connections towards the source and the target RNC by initiating the Iu Release procedure with an appropriate value for the Cause IE, e.g. "TRELOCcomplete expiry".
Interactions with the Relocation Detect procedure:
If the RELOCATION DETECT message is not received by the CN before reception of the RELOCATION COMPLETE message, the CN shall handle the RELOCATION COMPLETE message normally.
8.9.4	Co-ordination of Two Iu Signalling Connections
When the Relocation Complete procedure is to be initiated by the target RNC, the target RNC shall initiate the Relocation Complete procedure on all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE between the target RNC and the CN.
8.10	Relocation Cancel
8.10.1	General
The purpose of the Relocation Cancel procedure is to enable a source RNC to cancel an ongoing relocation of SRNS. The Relocation Cancel procedure may be initiated by the source RNC during and after the Relocation Preparation procedure if either of the following conditions is fulfilled:
1.	The source RNC has not yet initiated the execution of relocation of SRNS, neither via the Iur interface nor via the Uu interface.
2.	After having initiated the execution of relocation of SRNS, the UE has returned to the source RNC by transmitting an RRC message which indicates that the UE considers the source RNC as its serving RNC.
The procedure shall be co-ordinated in all Iu signalling connections for which the Relocation Preparation procedure has been initiated. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.10.2	Successful Operation

Figure 11: Relocation Cancel procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by sending a RELOCATION CANCEL message to the CN. This message shall indicate the reason for cancelling the relocation of SRNS by the appropriate value of the Cause IE. Upon reception of a RELOCATION CANCEL message, the CN shall send a RELOCATION CANCEL ACKNOWLEDGE message to the source RNC.
Transmission and reception of a RELOCATION CANCEL ACKNOWLEDGE message terminate the procedure in the CN and in the source RNC respectively. After this, the source RNC does not have a prepared relocation for that Iu signalling connection.
Interactions with Relocation Preparation procedure:
Upon reception of a RELOCATION CANCEL message from the source RNC, the CN shall locally terminate the possibly ongoing Relocation Preparation procedure towards that RNC and abandon the relocation of SRNS.
If the source RNC receives a RELOCATION COMMAND message from the CN after the Relocation Cancel procedure is initiated, the source RNC shall ignore the received RELOCATION COMMAND message.
If the source RNC receives a RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message from the CN after the Relocation Cancel procedure is initiated, then the source RNC shall terminate the ongoing Relocation Cancel procedure.
8.10.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.10.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.10.5	Co-ordination of Two Iu Signalling Connections
If the Relocation Cancel procedure is to be initiated due to other reasons than reception of a RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message, the Relocation Cancel procedure shall be initiated on all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE in which the Relocation Preparation procedure has not terminated unsuccessfully.
8.11	SRNS Context Transfer
8.11.1	General
The purpose of the SRNS Context Transfer procedure is to trigger the transfer of SRNS contexts from the source RNC to the CN (PS domain) in case of intersystem change or in some further cases described in TS 23.060 [21]. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.11.2	Successful Operation

Figure 12: SRNS Context Transfer procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending an SRNS CONTEXT REQUEST message to the source RNC. The SRNS CONTEXT REQUEST message shall include the list of RABs whose contexts should be transferred, and may include the RAT Type IE, when available to indicate the RAT from which the context request originates.
The source RNC shall respond to the CN with an SRNS CONTEXT RESPONSE message containing all the referenced RABs, including both successful and unsuccessful RABs transfers. For each RAB whose transfer is successful, the following context information elements shall be included:
-	RAB ID IE;
-	always when available, the sequence number for the next downlink GTP‑PDU to be sent to the UE, i.e. the DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	always when available, the sequence number for the next uplink GTP‑PDU to be tunnelled to the GGSN, i.e. the UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323 [17] of the next downlink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been sent to the UE by a source system, i.e. the DL N-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323 [17] of the next uplink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been expected from the UE by a source system, i.e. the UL N-PDU Sequence Number IE.
Transmission and reception of the SRNS CONTEXT RESPONSE message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
8.11.3	Unsuccessful Operation
For each RAB for which the UTRAN is not able to transfer the RAB context, e.g. if the RAB ID is unknown to the RNC, the RAB ID is included in the SRNS CONTEXT RESPONSE message together with a Cause IE, e.g. "Invalid RAB ID".
8.11.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.12	SRNS Data Forwarding Initiation
8.12.1	General
The purpose of the SRNS Data Forwarding procedure is to trigger the transfer of N-PDUs from the RNC to the CN (PS domain) in case of intersystem change or in some further cases described in TS 23.060 [21]. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.12.2	Successful Operation

Figure 13: SRNS Data Forwarding Initiation procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending an SRNS DATA FORWARD COMMAND message to the UTRAN. The SRNS DATA FORWARD COMMAND message includes the list of RABs towards the PS domain whose data should be forwarded, and the necessary information for establishing a GTP tunnel to be used for data forwarding. For each indicated RAB, the list shall include the RAB ID IE, the Transport Layer Address IE and the Iu Transport Association IE.
Upon reception of the SRNS DATA FORWARD COMMAND message the RNC starts the timer TDATAfwd.
8.12.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.13	SRNS Context Forwarding from Source RNC to CN
8.13.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer SRNS contexts from the source RNC to the CN (PS domain) in case of handover via the CN. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling. SRNS contexts are sent for each concerned RAB among those that are supported by the target system, and for which at least either GTP-PDU or PDCP sequence numbering is available. The SRNS contexts contain the sequence numbers of the next GTP-PDUs to be transmitted in the uplink and downlink directions, if available, and the next PDCP sequence numbers that would have been used to send and receive data from the UE, if available. The Source RNC PDCP context info shall be sent if available.
8.13.2	Successful Operation

Figure 14: SRNS Context forwarding from source RNC to CN. Successful operation.
The source RNC initialises the procedure by sending a FORWARD SRNS CONTEXT message to the CN. The FORWARD SRNS CONTEXT message contains the RAB Context information for each referenced RAB. For each RAB the following information shall be included:
-	RAB ID IE;
-	always when available, the sequence number for the next downlink GTP‑PDU to be sent to the UE, i.e. the DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	always when available, the sequence number for the next uplink GTP‑PDU to be tunnelled to the GGSN, i.e. the UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323 [17] of the next uplink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been expected from the UE by a source system i.e. the UL N-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323 [17] of the next downlink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been sent to the UE by a source system i.e. the DL N-PDU Sequence Number IE.
8.13.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.14	SRNS Context Forwarding to Target RNC from CN
8.14.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer SRNS contexts from the CN (PS domain) to the target RNC in case of handover via the CN. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling. SRNS contexts are sent for each referenced RAB, for which at least either GTP-PDU or PDCP sequence numbering is available. The SRNS contexts contain the sequence numbers of the next GTP-PDUs to be transmitted in the uplink and downlink directions, if available, and the next PDCP sequence numbers that would have been used to send and receive data from the UE, if available. The source RNC PDCP context info shall be sent if available.
8.14.2	Successful Operation

Figure 15: SRNS Context forwarding to target RNC from CN. Successful operation.
The CN initialises the procedure by sending FORWARD SRNS CONTEXT message to the target RNC. The FORWARD SRNS CONTEXT message contains the RAB Context information for each referenced RAB. For each RAB the following information shall be included:
-	RAB ID IE;
-	always when available, the sequence number for the next downlink GTP‑PDU to be sent to the UE, i.e. the DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	always when available, the sequence number for the next uplink GTP‑PDU to be tunnelled to the GGSN, i.e. the UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323 [17] of the next uplink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been expected from the UE by a source system i.e. the UL N-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323 [17] of the next downlink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been sent to the UE by a source system i.e. the DL N-PDU Sequence Number IE.
8.14.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.15	Paging
8.15.1	General
The purpose of the Paging procedure is to enable the CN to request the UTRAN to contact that UE. The procedure uses connectionless signalling.
8.15.2	Successful Operation

Figure 16: Paging procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a PAGING message. The PAGING message shall contain the following IEs:
-	CN Domain Indicator
-	Permanent NAS UE Identity
-	DRX Cycle Length Coefficient (if available)
The PAGING message may contain following IEs:
-	Temporary UE Identity
-	Paging Area
-	Paging Cause
-	Non Searching Indication
-	Global CN-ID
-	CSG Id List
The CN Domain Indicator IE shall be used by the RNC to identify from which CN domain the paging request originates.
The Permanent NAS UE Identity IE (i.e. IMSI) shall be used by the UTRAN paging co-ordination function to check if a signalling connection towards the other CN domain already exists for this UE. In that case, the radio interface paging message shall be sent via that connection instead of using the paging broadcast channel.
The Temporary UE Identity IE (e.g. TMSI) is the temporary identity of the user (allocated by that CN Domain) which can be used in a radio interface paging message. If the Temporary UE Identity IE is not included in the PAGING message, the RNC shall use the Permanent NAS UE Identity instead – if no signalling connection exists.
If NNSF is active, and the Temporary UE Identity IE is not included in the PAGING message, the PAGING message shall include the Global CN-ID IE and, in case this PAGING message is originated from the CS domain, the RNC may start the T NNSF timer and store the Permanent NAS UE Identity IE along with the related Global CN-ID IE until the T NNSF timer has expired.
The Paging Area IE shall be used by the RNC to identify the area in which the radio interface paging message shall be broadcast in case no signalling connection, as described above, already exists for the UE. If the Paging Area IE is not included in the PAGING message, the whole RNC area shall be used as Paging Area – if no signalling connection exists for that UE.
The Paging Cause IE shall indicate to the RNC the reason for sending the PAGING message. The paging cause is transferred transparently to the UE.
The Non Searching Indication IE shall, if present, be used by the RNC to decide whether the UTRAN paging co-ordination function needs to be activated or not. In the absence of this IE, UTRAN paging co-ordination shall be performed.
The DRX Cycle Length Coefficient IE may be included in the PAGING message, and if present, the UTRAN shall, when applicable, use it for calculating the paging occasions for the UE.
A list of CSG IDs may be included in the PAGING message. If included, the UTRAN may use the list of CSG IDs to avoid paging the UE at CSG cells whose CSG ID does not appear in the list.
It should be noted that each PAGING message on the Iu interface relates to only one UE and therefore the RNC has to pack the pages into the relevant radio interface paging message.
The core network is responsible for the paging repetition over the Iu interface.
8.15.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.16	Common ID
8.16.1	General
The purpose of the Common ID procedure is to inform the RNC about the permanent NAS UE Identity (i.e. IMSI) of a user. This is used by the RNC e.g. to create a reference between the permanent NAS UE identity of the user and the RRC connection of that user for UTRAN paging co-ordination. The procedure may also be used to provide the SNA Access Information IE to the RNC or to provide the Management Based MDT Allowed IE to the RNC or to provide the Management Based MDT PLMN List IE to the RNC.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.16.2	Successful Operation

Figure 17: Common ID procedure. Successful operation.
After having established an Iu signalling connection, and if the Permanent NAS UE identity (i.e. IMSI) is available, the CN shall send to the RNC a COMMON ID message containing the Permanent NAS UE Identity IE and optionally the SNA Access Information IE. The COMMON ID message may also include the UESBI-Iu IE. The RNC shall associate the permanent identity to the RRC Connection of that user and shall save it for the duration of the RRC connection.
The RNC shall, if supported, use the UESBI-Iu IE when received in the COMMON ID message. If UESBI-Iu IE contains an IMEISV the RNC may use this information to determine the characteristics of the UE for subsequent handling.
If the CSG Membership Status IE is included in the COMMON ID message the RAN shall, if supported, take the following actions:
-	If the cell that serves the UE is a Hybrid cell, the RNC shall store the value contained in the CSG Membership Status IE and replace any previously stored membership status value by this new one. The RNC may use such information to perform differentiated treatment for member and non-member UEs. 
-	If the cell that serves the UE is a CSG cell, and the CSG Membership Status IE is set to “non-member”, the RNC should initiate actions to ensure that the UE is no longer served by the CSG cell as defined in TS 25.467 [55].
If the SNA Access Information IE is contained in the COMMON ID message, the RNC shall store this information and use it to determine whether the UE has access to radio resources in the UTRAN. The RNC shall consider that the UE is authorised to access only the PLMNs identified by the PLMN identity IEs in the SNA Access Information IE. If the Authorised SNAs IE is included for a given PLMN (identified by the PLMN identity IE), then the RNC shall consider that the access to radio resources for the concerned UE is restricted to the LAs contained in the SNAs identified by the SNAC IEs.
If the Power Saving Indicator IE is contained in the COMMON ID message and the RNC shall if supported, store this information and use when determining to send the UE back to the PSM mode if the value is "PSM Configured" or to send the UE back to the eDRX mode in Idle if the value is "eDRX Configured", as defined in TS 23.682 [68].
In case of GWCN configuration for a network sharing non-supporting UE, the COMMON ID message shall include, if available, the Selected PLMN identity IE. If received, the RNC shall store this information.
In case SRVCC functionality is supported by the UE and CN, the CN shall include SRVCC Operation Possible IE in COMMON ID message.
In case rSRVCC functionality is supported by the UE and CN, the CN shall include rSRVCC Operation Possible IE in COMMON ID message.
If the Management Based MDT Allowed IE is included in the COMMON ID message, the RNC shall use it, if supported, together with information in the Management Based MDT PLMN List IE, if available, to allow subsequent selection of the UE for management based MDT as defined in TS 32.422 [38].
Upon receipt of the COMMON ID message the RNC shall
-	store the Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority IE and use it as defined in TS 36.300 [52].
Upon receipt of the COMMON ID message the RNC may
-	store the Last E-UTRAN PLMN Identity IE and use it as defined in TS 23.272 [67].
8.16.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.17	CN Invoke Trace
8.17.1	General
When used for signalling based activation, the purpose of the CN Invoke Trace procedure is to inform the RNC that it should begin a trace session with the parameters indicated by the CN and related to the UE, the Iu connection is used for.
When used for management based activation, the purpose of the CN Invoke Trace procedure is to provide the RNC with the equipment identity of the UE for which the RNC should begin a trace recording session.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.17.2	Successful Operation

Figure 18: CN Invoke Trace procedure. Successful operation.
The CN Invoke Trace procedure is invoked by the CN by sending a CN INVOKE TRACE message to the RNC as defined in TS 32.422 [38].
The CN INVOKE TRACE message shall include the following IEs:
-	The Trace Reference IE, which uniquely identifies the trace session it refers to.
-	The UE Identity IE, which indicates the UE to which this trace session pertains.
-	The Trace Propagation Parameters IE, only in case of a signalling based activation.
If present, the Trace Propagation Parameters IE shall include the following IEs:
-	The Trace Recording Session Reference IE, which is allocated by the CN.
-	The Trace Depth IE, which defines how detailed information should be recorded for this trace session in the RNC.
The Trace Propagation Parameters IE may also include the List Of Interfaces To Trace IE, which defines which interfaces should be traced in the RNC. If the List Of Interfaces To Trace IE is not included, the RNC should trace all the following interfaces, if available: Iu-CS, Iu-PS, Uu, Iur and Iub.
Upon receiving the CN INVOKE TRACE message, which includes the Trace Propagation Parameters IE, the RNC should begin a trace recording session according to the parameters indicated in the CN INVOKE TRACE message. If the RNC does not support the requested value "Minimum" or "Medium" of the Trace Depth IE, the RNC should begin a trace recording session with maximum trace depth.
Upon receiving the CN INVOKE TRACE message, which does not include the Trace Propagation Parameters IE, the RNC should begin a trace recording session according to the parameters configured in the RNC for the indicated equipment identity in the CN INVOKE TRACE message.
The RNC may not start a trace recording session if there are insufficient resources available within the RNC.
The Trace Reference IE, UE identity IE and, if the Trace Propagation Parameters IE is present, the Trace Recording Session Reference IE are used to tag the trace record to allow simpler construction of the total record by the entity which combines trace records.
If the MDT Configuration IE is included in the CN INVOKE TRACE message and includes the MDT Activation IE set to “Immediate MDT and Trace” then the RNC shall, if supported, initiate the requested trace function and MDT function as described in TS 32.422 [38].
If the MDT Configuration IE is included in the CN INVOKE TRACE message and includes the MDT Activation IE set to “Immediate MDT Only” or “Logged MDT only”, then the RNC shall, if supported, initiate the requested MDT function as described in TS 32.422 [38] and shall ignore the List of Interfaces to Trace IE and the Trace Depth IE.
If Trace Collection Entity IP Address IE is included and if the MDT Configuration IE is also included then the RNC shall, if supported, store the Trace Collection Entity IP address and use it when transferring Trace records, otherwise if MDT Configuration IE is not included, the RNC may use the Trace Collection Entity IP address when transferring trace records.
If the MDT Configuration IE is included in the CN INVOKE TRACE message and includes the Signalling based MDT PLMN List IE, then the RNC may used it to propagate the trace function as described in TS 37.320 [64].
If the UE Application Layer measurement configuration IE is included in the CN INVOKE TRACE message then the RNC shall, if supported, initiate the requested trace function and QoE function as described in TS 25.300 [72].
Interaction with Relocation and Enhanced Relocation:
In case of signalling based activation, the order to perform tracing is lost in UTRAN at successful Relocation of SRNS. If the tracing shall continue also after the relocation has been performed, the CN Invoke Trace procedure shall thus be re-initiated from the CN towards the future SRNC after the Relocation Resource Allocation or the Enhanced Relocation procedure has been executed successfully.
8.17.2.1	Successful Operation for GERAN Iu mode
The CN INVOKE TRACE message shall include the Trace Type IE to indicate the events and parameters to be recorded.
The message shall include a Trace Reference IE which is allocated by the entity which triggered the trace.
The message may include the OMC ID IE, which if present, indicates the OMC to which the record is destined.
The message may include the UE Identity IE, which if present, indicates the UE to which this record pertains to.
The message may include the Trigger ID IE, which if present, indicates the entity which triggered the trace.
The Trace Reference and Trigger ID IEs are used to tag the trace record to allow simpler construction of the total record by the entity which combines trace records.
8.17.3	Abnormal Conditions
If the MDT Configuration IE is included in the CN INVOKE TRACE message and the Trace Collection Entity IP Address IE is not included, the RNC shall ignore the MDT Configuration.
If the QoE Configuration IE is included in the CN INVOKE TRACE message and the Trace Collection Entity IP Address IE is not included, the RNC shall ignore the QoE Configuration.
8.17.3.1	Abnormal Conditions for GERAN Iu mode
Not applicable.
8.18	Security Mode Control
8.18.1	General
The purpose of the Security Mode Control procedure is to pass ciphering and integrity mode information to the UTRAN. The UTRAN uses this information to select and load the encryption device for user and signalling data with the appropriate parameters, and also to store the appropriate parameters for the integrity algorithm. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.18.2	Successful Operation

Figure 19: Security Mode Control procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message. The message may contain the Encryption Information IE and shall contain the Integrity Protection Information IE, specifying, in preferred order with the most preferred first in the list, which ciphering, if any, and integrity protection algorithms may be used by the UTRAN.
The Permitted Encryption Algorithms IE within the Encryption Information IE may contain "no encryption" within an element of its list in order to allow the RNC not to cipher the respective connection. This can be done either by not starting ciphering or by using the UEA0 algorithm. In the absence of the Encryption Information group IE in SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the RNC shall not start ciphering.
Upon reception of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UTRAN shall internally select appropriate algorithms, taking into account the UE/UTRAN capabilities. If a signalling connection already exists towards the other core network domain and integrity has been started, the same ciphering and integrity alternatives as being used for that core network domain shall be selected. If a signalling connection already exists towards the other core network domain and the Security Mode Control procedure is ongoing on that core network domain, the same ciphering and integrity alternative shall be selected for the two domains. This means in particular for encryption that if "no encryption" or no Encryption Information IE has been received from the first core network domain and integrity has been started but ciphering has not been started, ciphering shall also not be started for the second core network domain. The UTRAN shall then trigger the execution of the corresponding radio interface procedure and, if applicable, start/restart the encryption device and also start/modify the integrity protection.
The CN may send a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message towards the RNC also when integrity protection and possibly ciphering has already been started for an existing signalling connection towards that core network domain. This may be used to activate new integrity protection and ciphering keys. The included integrity protection and ciphering information shall then support (at least) the integrity protection alternative and the ciphering alternative presently being used and the Key Status IE shall have the value "New".
When the execution of the radio interface procedure is successfully finished, the UTRAN shall return a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message to the CN. This message shall include the Chosen Integrity Protection Algorithm IE and may include the Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE.
The Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE shall be included in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message if, and only if the Encryption Information IE was included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
The set of permitted algorithms specified in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message shall remain applicable for subsequent RAB Assignments and Intra-UTRAN Relocations.
In case of a UE with Radio Access Bearers towards both core networks, the user data towards CS shall always be ciphered with the ciphering key received from CS and the user data towards PS with the ciphering key received from PS. The signalling data shall always be ciphered with the last received ciphering key and integrity protected with the last received integrity protection key from any of the two CNs.
8.18.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 20: Security Mode Control procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the UTRAN or the UE is unable to support the ciphering and/or integrity protection algorithms specified in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, then the UTRAN shall return to the CN a SECURITY MODE REJECT message with cause value "Requested Ciphering and/or Integrity Protection Algorithms not Supported". If the radio interface Security Mode Control procedure fails, a SECURITY MODE REJECT message shall be sent to the CN with cause value "Failure in the Radio Interface Procedure".
8.18.4	Abnormal Conditions
If, when establishing a signalling connection towards a second core network domain, the integrity has already been started by the first domain and the integrity protection and ciphering information specified in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message does not support the integrity protection alternative and the ciphering alternative presently being used, a SECURITY MODE REJECT message shall be sent to the second core network domain with cause value "Conflict with already existing Integrity protection and/or Ciphering information".
If, upon reception of a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message from a core network domain with an already existing signalling connection from that core network domain and for which integrity protection and possibly ciphering have already been started, the Key Status IE has the value "Old", a SECURITY MODE REJECT message shall be returned with cause value "Conflict with already existing Integrity protection and/or Ciphering information".
If, upon reception of a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message from a core network domain with an already existing signalling connection and for which integrity protection and possibly ciphering have already been started, the included integrity protection and ciphering information does not support the integrity protection alternative and the ciphering alternative presently being used, a SECURITY MODE REJECT message shall be returned with cause value "Conflict with already existing Integrity protection and/or Ciphering information".
8.19	Location Reporting Control
8.19.1	General
The purpose of the Location Reporting Control procedure is to allow the CN to request information on the location and optionally velocity of a given UE. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.19.2	Successful Operation

Figure 21: Location Reporting Control procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message.
The Request Type IE shall indicate to the serving RNC whether:
-	to report directly;
-	to stop a direct report;
-	to report periodically;
-	to stop periodic reporting;
-	to report upon change of Service area, or
-	to stop reporting at change of Service Area.
If reporting upon change of Service Area is requested, the Serving RNC shall report whenever the UE moves between Service Areas. For this procedure, only Service Areas that are defined for the PS and CS domains shall be considered.
The Request Type IE shall also indicate what type of location information the serving RNC shall report. The location information is either of the following types:
-	Service Area Identifier, or
-	Geographical area, including geographical coordinates with or without requested accuracy. If the Vertical Accuracy Code IE is included, the Accuracy Code IE in the Request Type IE shall be present. The Accuracy Code IE shall be understood as the horizontal accuracy code.
A request for a direct report or for periodic reporting can be done in parallel with having an active request to report upon change of Service Area for the same UE. The request to report upon change of Service Area shall not be affected by this.
Any of the Vertical Accuracy Code IE, Response Time IE, Positioning Priority IE, Client Type IE or Periodic Location Info IE shall be included according to the following rules:
-	Vertical Accuracy Code shall be included, if available, in connection with Geographical Area,
-	Response time shall be included, if available, in connection with request for start of direct reporting of Geographical Area,
-	Client type shall be included in connection with request for start of direct reporting of Geographical Area and, if available, in request for direct reporting of SAI or periodic reporting,
-	Positioning Priority shall be included, if available, in connection with request for start of direct reporting or in connection with request for start of reporting upon change of Service Area,
-	Periodic Location Info shall be included in connection with a request for start of periodic reporting of Geographical Area.
When no Positioning Priority IE is included, the RNC shall consider the request as if "Normal Priority" value had been received.
When no Response Time IE is included, the RNC shall consider the request as if "Delay Tolerant" value had been received.
Interaction with Relocation and Enhanced Relocation:
The order to perform location reporting at change of Service Area is lost in UTRAN at successful Relocation of SRNS. If the location reporting at change of Service Area shall continue also after the relocation has been performed, the Location Reporting Control procedure shall thus be re-initiated from the CN towards the future SRNC after the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure or the Enhanced Relocation procedure has been executed successfully.
8.19.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.20	Location Report
8.20.1	General
The purpose of the Location Report procedure is to provide the UE's location and optionally velocity information to the CN. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.20.2	Successful Operation

Figure 22: Location Report procedure. Successful operation.
The serving RNC initiates the procedure by generating a LOCATION REPORT message. The LOCATION REPORT message may be used as a response to a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message. Also, when a user enters or leaves a classified zone set by O&M, e.g. a zone where a disaster has occurred, a LOCATION REPORT message including the Service Area of the UE in the Area Identity IE shall be sent to the CN. The Cause IE shall indicate the appropriate cause value to the CN, e.g. "User Restriction Start Indication" and "User Restriction End Indication". The CN shall react to the LOCATION REPORT message with CN vendor specific actions.
For this procedure, only Service Areas that are defined for the PS and CS domains shall be considered.
In case reporting at change of Service Area is requested by the CN, then the RNC shall issue a LOCATION REPORT message:
-	whenever the information given in the previous LOCATION REPORT message or INITIAL UE MESSAGE message is not anymore valid.
-	upon receipt of the first LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message following a Relocation Resource Allocation procedure, with the Event IE included in the Request Type IE set to "Change of Service Area", as soon as SAI becomes available in the new SRNC and the relocation procedure has been successfully completed.
In case a Service Area is reported, the RNC shall include in the Area Identity IE of the LOCATION REPORT message a Service Area that includes at least one of the cells from which the UE is consuming radio resources.
In case the LOCATION REPORT message is sent as an answer to a request for a direct report, for periodic reporting or for reports at a change of Service Area, the Request Type IE from the LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message shall be included.
If the LOCATION REPORT message is sent as an answer to a request for a direct report of Service Area and the current Service Area cannot be determined by the RNC, then the Area Identity IE shall be omitted and a cause value shall be included to indicate that the request could not be fulfilled, e.g. "Requested Information Not Available" or "Location Reporting Congestion". The RNC may also include the Last Known Service Area IE.
If the RNC cannot deliver the location information as requested by the CN, due to either the non-support of the requested event or the non-support of the requested report area, or if the RNC is currently not able to reach the UE, the RNC shall indicate the UE location to be "Undetermined" by omitting the Area Identity IE. A cause value shall instead be added to indicate the reason for the undetermined location, e.g. "Requested Request Type not supported", "Location Reporting Congestion" or "No Resource Available".
In case of periodic reporting is requested by the CN, the RNC shall issue the first LOCATION REPORT message one reporting interval as indicated in the Reporting Interval IE contained in the LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message after reception of the LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message and continue to send LOCATION REPORT messages one reporting interval after the previous LOCATION REPORT message until the desired amount of reports as given in the Reporting Amount IE has been attained, or until the periodic reporting is cancelled by the CN or aborted by the RNC. When no location estimate is available at the RNC when the reporting criteria are fulfilled (e.g., due to failure of a position method itself), the RNC shall indicate the UE location to be "Undetermined" by omitting the Area Identity IE. A cause value shall instead be added to indicate the reason for the undetermined location, e.g. "Periodic Location Information not Available".
If the Location Report procedure was triggered by a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message, which included a request to report a geographical area with a specific accuracy, the LOCATION REPORT message shall include:
-	the Geographical Area IE within the Area Identity IE containing either a point with indicated uncertainty or a polygon or another type, which fulfils the requested accuracy, and
-	the Accuracy Fulfilment Indicator IE with the value "requested accuracy fulfilled".
If the Location Report procedure was triggered by a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message, which included a request to report with a geographical area and whenever one of the geographic area shapes Ellipsoid point with uncertainty Ellipse IE, Ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty Ellipsoid IE or Ellipsoid Arc IE is reported, the Confidence IE shall indicate the probability that the UE is located within the uncertainty region of the shape. The value of the Confidence IE shall be in the interval of "1" to "100".
If any of the requested accuracy cannot be fulfilled, the LOCATION REPORT message shall include:
-	the Geographical Area IE within the Area Identity IE containing either a point with indicated uncertainty or a polygon or another type, with the best possible accuracy, and
-	the Accuracy Fulfilment Indicator IE with the value "requested accuracy not fulfilled".
If the Confidence IE received from the UE has value "0", the RNC shall consider the requested accuracy as not fulfilled and if the received position is reported or forwarded then the confidence and uncertainty shape shall not be included (i.e. either the Point IE or the Ellipsoid point with altitude IE shall be used).
If, on the other hand, no specific accuracy level was requested in the LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message, the LOCATION REPORT message shall include the Geographical Area IE within the Area Identity IE, the reported Geographical Area IE may include an accuracy.
The LOCATION REPORT message shall also include, if available, the Position Data IE containing the positioning method (or list of positioning methods) used successfully to obtain the location estimate, together with the usage information.
The LOCATION REPORT message may also include, if available, the Barometric Pressure IE containing the uncompensated barometric pressure measured by the UE.
The LOCATION REPORT message may also include, if available, the Civic Address IE containing the location estimate for the UE expressed as a civic address.
If the Location Report procedure was triggered by a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message which included a request to report with a geographical area and in which the IncludeVelocity IE was set to "requested", the LOCATION REPORT message shall include a Velocity Estimate IE, if available and if the handling of velocity is supported by the RNC.
If the Location Report procedure was triggered by a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message, which included a request to report with a geographical area and in which the Client Type IE was not included, the RNC shall answer with the Point IE, or the Point With Uncertainty IE or the Polygon IE within the Geographical Area IE of the LOCATION REPORT message.
8.20.3	Abnormal Conditions

8.21	Data Volume Report
8.21.1	General
The Data Volume Report procedure is used by CN to request the unsuccessfully transmitted DL data volume for specific RABs. This procedure only applies to the PS domain. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
NOTE: 	In line with TS32.240 [61], this procedure is not used and the RNC should ignore a DATA VOLUME REPORT REQUEST message if received.
8.21.2	Successful Operation

Figure 23: Data Volume Report procedure. Successful operation.
The procedure is initiated by CN by sending DATA VOLUME REPORT REQUEST message to UTRAN. This message shall contain the list of RAB ID IEs to identify the RABs for which the unsuccessfully transmitted DL data volume shall be reported.
At reception of a DATA VOLUME REPORT REQUEST message, the UTRAN shall produce a DATA VOLUME REPORT message. For each RAB successfully addressed within the RAB Data Volume Report List IE of the DATA VOLUME REPORT REQUEST message, the DATA VOLUME REPORT message shall include in the Unsuccessfully Transmitted DL Data Volume IE the amount of unsuccessfully transmitted DL data since the last data volume reported to the CN for the RAB and with the same data volume reference, if present. The message may also contain the Data Volume Reference IE.
The message may contain for each RAB successfully addressed a maximum of two RAB Data Volume Report Item IEs within the RAB Data Volume Report List IE for the case when there is a need to report two different data volumes since the last data volume indication to the CN. The UTRAN shall also reset the data volume counter for the reported RABs. The UTRAN shall send the DATA VOLUME REPORT message to the CN. Transmission and reception of the DATA VOLUME REPORT message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
The Data Volume Reference IE, if included, indicates the time when the data volume is counted.
8.21.3	Unsuccessful Operation
The RAB ID IE for each RAB for which UTRAN is not able to transfer a data volume report is included in the DATA VOLUME REPORT message together with a Cause IE, e.g. "Invalid RAB ID".
8.21.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.22	Initial UE Message
8.22.1	General
The purpose of the Initial UE Message procedure is to establish an Iu signalling connection between a CN domain and the RNC and to transfer the initial NAS-PDU to the CN node as determined by the NAS Node Selection Function - if this function is active, or otherwise to the default CN node- or by the Rerouting Function (see TS 25.410 [2]) in case of MOCN configuration. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.22.2	Successful Operation

Figure 24: Initial UE Message procedure. Successful operation.
When the RNC has received from radio interface a NAS message (see TS 24.008 [8]) to be forwarded to a CN domain to which no Iu signalling connection for the UE exists, the RNC shall initiate the Initial UE Message procedure and send the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message to the CN. If NNSF is active, the selection of the CN node is made according to TS 23.236 [26].
In addition to the received NAS-PDU, the RNC shall add the following information to the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message:
-	CN domain indicator, indicating the CN domain towards which this message is sent.
-	For CS domain, the LAI which is the last LAI indicated to the UE by the UTRAN via the current RRC connection, or if the UTRAN has not yet indicated any LAI to the UE via the current RRC connection, then the LAI of the cell via which the current RRC connection was established.
-	For PS domain, the LAI+RAC which are the last LAI+RAC indicated to the UE by UTRAN via the current RRC connection, or if the UTRAN has not yet indicated any LAI+RAC to the UE via the current RRC connection, then the LAI+RAC of the cell via which the current RRC connection was established.
-	Service Area corresponding to at least one of the cells from which the UE is consuming radio resources.
-	Iu signalling connection identifier.
-	Global RNC identifier.
-	Selected PLMN Identity, if received from radio interface by a network sharing supporting UE in shared networks.
-	Redirect Attempt Flag, in MOCN configuration for a network sharing non supporting UE in order to indicate that the CN shall respond with a Redirection Indication IE or a Redirection Completed IE.
The Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IE contains an Iu signalling connection identifier which is allocated by the RNC. The value for the Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IE shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify an Iu signalling connection for the RNC. The CN should store and remember this identifier for the duration of the Iu connection.
Whereas several processing entities within the CN (e.g. charging, interception, etc.) may make use of the location information given in the SAI IE and the LAI (and RAC for PS domain) IE, the mobility management within the CN shall rely on the information given within the LAI IE (respectively LAI and RAC IEs for PS domain) only.
If the establishment of the Iu signalling connection towards the CN is performed due to an RRC connection establishment originating from a CSG cell and if the UE is CSG capable, the CSG Id IE shall be included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message. 
If the establishment of the Iu signalling connection towards the CN is performed due to an RRC connection establishment originating from a Hybrid cell and if the UE is CSG capable, the CSG Id IE and Cell Access Mode IE shall be included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message. 
If the RNC has a co-located L-GW for LIPA operation, it shall include the L-GW Transport Layer Address IE in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.
If the SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE is received in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message, the CN shall, if supported, use it for SIPTO@LN operation as specified in TS 23.060 [21].
If the LHN ID IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message, the CN shall, if supported, use it as specified in TS 23.060 [21].
If the Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message then the CN shall, if supported, use the IE as described in TS 23.060 [21].
If the Tunnel Information for BBF IE is received in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message, the CN shall, if supported, use the IE as described in TS 23.139 [65].
If the SGSN Group Identity IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message this indicates that the message is rerouted for DCN, and the SGSN shall, if supported, use the IE as described in TS 23.060 [21].
If the UE Usage Type IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message, then the selected SGSN node in the DCN shall if supported, use it as defined in TS 23.401 [48].
If the DCN ID IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message, the SGSN shall, if supported, use it as defined in TS 23.401 [48].
If the UE indicates the support for UE Application Layer Measurement, the RNC shall if supported include the UE Application Layer Measurement Capability IE in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.
Interaction with Direct Transfer procedure
In MOCN configuration, if the RNC receives the Redirection Indication IE in the DIRECT TRANSFER message from a CN node which is not the last attempted, it shall initiate the Initial UE Message procedure towards another CN operator when possible (or possibly to the same CN in case when CS/PS coordination is required), with the following additional information in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message:
-	NAS Sequence Number IE, if received from previously attempted CN operator;
-	Permanent NAS UE Identity IE, if received from one of previously attempted CN operators.
In MOCN configurations, if the RNC receives the Redirection Indication IE containing the Additional CS/PS coordination information IE in the DIRECT TRANSFER message from a CN node and if the RNC cannot identify one operator from this information as described in TS 23.251 [39], then the RNC shall if supported initiate the UE Registration Query procedure towards the CN nodes of the other domain before initiating the Initial UE Message procedure towards another CN operator.
8.22.2.1	Successful Operation for GERAN Iu-mode
For GERAN Iu-mode, the following shall apply in addition for the successful operation of the Initial UE Message procedure:
-	In case of establishment of a signalling connection towards the CS domain in GERAN Iu-mode, the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message shall contain the GERAN Classmark IE in order to provide the CN with GERAN-specific information (see TS 43.051 [27]).
8.23	Direct Transfer
8.23.1	General
The purpose of the Direct Transfer procedure is to carry UE – CN signalling messages over the Iu Interface. The UE ‑ CN signalling messages are not interpreted by the UTRAN, and their content (e.g. MM or CC message) is outside the scope of this specification (see TS 24.008 [8]). The UE – CN signalling messages are transported as a parameter in the DIRECT TRANSFER messages. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.23.2	Successful Operation
8.23.2.1	CN Originated Direct Transfer

Figure 25: Direct Transfer, CN originated. Successful operation.
If a UE - CN signalling message has to be sent from the CN to the UE, the CN shall send a DIRECT TRANSFER message to the RNC including the UE - CN signalling message as a NAS-PDU IE.
If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent in the downlink direction, it shall include the SAPI IE and shall not include the LAI + RAC IE and the SAI IE. The use of the SAPI IE included in the DIRECT TRANSFER message enables the UTRAN to provide specific service for the transport of the included NAS message.
Upon receipt of the DIRECT TRANSFER message the RNC shall
-	store the Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority IE and use it as defined in TS 36.300 [52].
In case of rerouting in MOCN configuration:
If the CN can serve the network sharing non-supporting UE and CS/PS coordination is not required, the NAS-PDU IE - i.e. the accept NAS message - and the Redirection Completed IE shall be included in the DIRECT TRANSFER message for the downlink direction.
If the CN cannot serve the network sharing non-supporting UE, the NAS-PDU IE - i.e. the reject NAS message - and a Redirection Completed IE shall be included in the DIRECT TRANSFER message for the downlink direction, except for some particular reject causes, see Annex N TS 24.008 [8]. For these particular reject causes, the NAS-PDU IE and the Redirection Indication IE shall be included in the DIRECT TRANSFER message for the downlink direction.
If CS/PS coordination is required, the NAS-PDU IE - i.e. the reject NAS message - and a Redirection Indication IE shall be included in the DIRECT TRANSFER message for the downlink direction.
The Redirection Indication IE shall contain:
-	The initial NAS-PDU IE received from the UE;
-	The Reject Cause Value IE;
-	The NAS Sequence Number IE, if available for CS;
-	The Permanent NAS UE Identity IE, if available.
The Redirection Indication IE may also according to TS 23.251 [39] contain:
-	The Additional CS/PS coordination information IE;
Upon reception of the downlink DIRECT TRANSFER message including the Redirection Indication IE, the RNC shall store as part of the Rerouting Function the associated Reject Cause Value IE and NAS-PDU IE related to this CN. In case the Reject Cause Value IE is set to "CS/PS coordination required", then the RNC shall perform CS/PS coordination based on the received Permanent NAS UE Identity IE and the Additional CS/PS coordination information IE if available. In this case the Reject Cause Value IE and the associated NAS-PDU IE shall not be stored. The CS/PS coordination may also use the UE Registration Query procedure towards the CN nodes of the other domain according to TS 23.251 [39].
In case all attempted CN operators have replied with the Redirection Indication IE, the RNC shall select the most appropriate NAS-PDU among the NAS-PDU IEs received from the attempted CN nodes based on the stored information as part of the Rerouting function and send it back to the UE.
Upon reception of the downlink DIRECT TRANSFER message including the Redirection Completed IE, the RNC shall send back the included NAS-PDU IE to the UE and terminate the Rerouting Function.
8.23.2.2	UTRAN Originated Direct Transfer

Figure 26: Direct Transfer, RNC originated. Successful operation.
If a UE - CN signalling message has to be sent from the RNC to the CN without interpretation, the RNC shall send a DIRECT TRANSFER message to the CN including the UE - CN signalling message as a NAS-PDU IE.
If the DIRECT TRANSFER message shall be sent to the PS domain, the RNC shall also add the LAI and the RAC IEs, which were the last LAI + RAC indicated to the UE by the UTRAN via the current RRC connection, or if the UTRAN had not yet indicated any LAI + RAC to the UE via the current RRC connection, then the LAI + RAC of the cell via which the current RRC connection was established. If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent to the PS domain, the RNC shall also add a Service Area corresponding to at least one of the cells from which the UE is consuming radio resources. If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent in uplink direction, the RNC shall not include the SAPI IE.
If the RNC has a co-located L-GW for LIPA operation, it shall include the L-GW Transport Layer Address IE in the DIRECT TRANSFER message.
If the SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE is received in the DIRECT TRANSFER message, the CN shall, if supported, use it for SIPTO@LN operation as specified in TS 23.060 [21].
If the LHN ID IE is included in the DIRECT TRANSFER message, the CN shall, if supported, use it as specified in TS 23.060 [21].
8.23.3	Abnormal Conditions
If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent by the RNC to the PS domain, and any of the LAI IE, RAC IE or SAI IE is missing, the CN shall continue with the Direct Transfer procedure, ignoring the missing IE.
If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent by the CN to the RNC without the SAPI IE, the RNC shall continue with the Direct Transfer procedure.
If Redirect Attempt Flag was sent in an INITIAL UE MESSAGE and the corresponding DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent by the CN to the RNC without Redirection Completed IE or Redirection Indication IE, the RNC shall send back the included NAS-PDU IE to the UE and terminate the Rerouting Function.
If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent by the CN to the RNC and it contains the SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE, the RNC shall consider the procedure as failed.
If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent by the CN to the RNC and it contains the LHN ID IE, the RNC shall consider the procedure as failed.

8.25	Overload Control
8.25.1	General
This procedure is defined to give some degree of signalling flow control. At the UTRAN side, "Processor Overload" and "Overload in the Capability to Send Signalling Messages to the UE" are catered for, and at the CN side, "Processor Overload" is catered for. The procedure uses connectionless signalling.
The philosophy used is to stem the traffic at source with known effect on the service. The algorithm used is:
At the CN side:
-	If TigOC is not running and an OVERLOAD message or "Signalling Point Congested" information is received, the traffic should be reduced by one step. It is also possible, optionally, to indicate the number of steps to reduce the traffic within the Number of Steps IE. At the same time, timers TigOC and TinTC should be started.
-	During TigOC all received OVERLOAD messages or "Signalling Point Congested" information should be ignored.
-	This step by step reduction of traffic should be continued until maximum reduction is obtained by arriving at the last step.
-	If TinTC expires, the traffic should be increased by one step and TinTC should be re-started unless the number of steps by which the traffic is reduced is back to zero.
At the UTRAN side:
-	If TigOR is not running and an OVERLOAD message not including the Priority Class Indicator IE or "Signalling Point Congested" information is received, all the traffic should be reduced by one step. It is also possible, optionally, to indicate the number of steps to reduce the traffic within the Number of Steps IE. At the same time, timers TigOR and TinTR should be started.
-	If TigOR is not running and an OVERLOAD message including the Priority Class Indicator IE is received and a procedure for reduction of all traffic is not being processed, then signalling traffic for the indicated priority class should be reduced by one step. It is also possible, optionally, to indicate the number of steps to reduce the traffic within the Number of Steps IE. At the same time, timers TigOR and TinTR should be started.
-	During TigOR all received OVERLOAD messages or "Signalling Point Congested" information should be ignored.
-	This step-by-step reduction of traffic should be continued until maximum reduction is obtained by arriving at the last step.
-	If TinTR expires, the traffic should be increased by one step and TinTR should be re-started unless the number of steps by which the traffic is reduced is back to zero.
The number of steps and the method for reducing the load are implementation-specific.
There may be other traffic control mechanisms from O&M activities occurring simultaneously.
8.25.2	Philosophy
Void.
8.25.3	Successful Operation
8.25.3.1	Overload at the CN

Figure 27: Overload at the CN. Successful operation.
The CN should indicate to the RNC that it is in a congested state by sending an OVERLOAD message. The CN Domain Indicator IE may be included, if the CN can determine the domain suffering from the signalling traffic overload. A specific CN node shall send this message only towards those RNCs from which it can receive the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.
Reception of the message by the UTRAN should cause reduction of signalling traffic towards the CN. If the CN Domain Indicator IE is included in the OVERLOAD message, and the Global CN-ID IE is not, the RNC should apply signalling traffic reduction mechanisms towards the indicated domain. If the Priority Class Indicator IE is included then the RNC should take the appropriate action to reduce the traffic for the priority class indicated in the IE.
If the NNSF is active, the CN shall include the Global CN-ID IE within the OVERLOAD message, and the RNC should apply signalling traffic reduction mechanisms towards the indicated CN node only.
8.25.3.2	Overload at the UTRAN

Figure 28: Overload at the UTRAN. Successful operation.
If the UTRAN is not capable of sending signalling messages to UEs due to overloaded resources, the UTRAN should send an OVERLOAD message to the CN. The RNC shall include the Global RNC-ID IE in this message. The message shall be sent only towards those CN nodes towards which the RNC can send the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message. If the Priority Class Indicator IE is included it shall be ignored.
8.25.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.26	Reset
8.26.1	General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise the UTRAN in the event of a failure in the CN or vice versa. The procedure uses connectionless signalling.

8.26.2.1	Reset Procedure Initiated from the CN

Figure 29: Reset procedure initiated from the CN. Successful operation.
In the event of a failure at the CN, which has resulted in the loss of transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the RNC. When a CN node sends this message towards an RNC for which it is not the default CN node, the Global CN-ID IE shall be included. This message is used by the UTRAN to release affected Radio Access Bearers and to erase all affected references for the specific CN node that sent the RESET message, i.e. the CN node indicated by the Global CN-ID IE or, if this IE is not included, the default CN node for the indicated CN domain.
After a guard period of TRatC seconds a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message shall be returned to the CN, indicating that all references at the UTRAN have been cleared. The RNC does not need to wait for the release of UTRAN radio resources or for the transport network layer signalling to be completed before returning the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
The RNC shall include the Global RNC-ID IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The Global RNC-ID IE shall not be included in the RESET message.
Interactions with other procedures:
In case of interactions with other procedures, the Reset procedure shall always override all other procedures.
8.26.2.2	Reset Procedure Initiated from the UTRAN

Figure 30: Reset procedure initiated from the UTRAN. Successful operation.
In the event of a failure at the UTRAN which has resulted in the loss of transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to all CN nodes towards which the RNC has Iu signalling connections established. This message is used by the CN to release affected Radio Access Bearers and to erase all affected references for the sending RNC.
The RNC shall include the Global RNC-ID IE in the RESET message.
After a guard period of TRatR seconds a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message shall be returned to the UTRAN indicating that all references have been cleared.
When a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message is sent from a CN node towards an RNC for which the sending CN node is not the default CN node, the Global CN-ID IE shall be included.
Interactions with other procedures:
In case of interactions with other procedures, the Reset procedure shall always override all other procedures.
8.26.3	Abnormal Conditions
8.26.3.1	Abnormal Condition at the CN
If the CN sends a RESET message to the RNC and receives no RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message within a period TRafR then it shall repeat the entire Reset procedure. The sending of the RESET message shall be repeated a maximum of "n" times where n is an operator matter. After the n-th unsuccessful repetition the procedure shall be stopped and e.g. the maintenance system be informed.
8.26.3.2	Abnormal Condition at the UTRAN
If the RNC sends a RESET message to the CN and receives no RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message within a period TRafC then it shall repeat the entire Reset procedure. The sending of the RESET message shall be repeated a maximum of "n" times where n is an operator matter. After the n-th unsuccessful repetition the procedure shall be stopped and e.g. the maintenance system be informed.
8.26.3.3	Crossing of Reset Messages
When an entity that has sent a RESET message and is waiting for a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, instead receives a RESET message from the peer entity, it shall stop timer TRafC or TRafR and send a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message to the peer entity.
8.27	Error Indication
8.27.1	General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node to report detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising dedicated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses connection oriented signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses connectionless signalling.
8.27.2	Successful Operation

Figure 31: Error Indication procedure, CN originated. Successful operation.


Figure 32: Error Indication procedure, RNC originated. Successful operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE.
Examples for possible cause values for protocol error indications are:
-	"Transfer Syntax Error"
-	"Semantic Error"
-	"Message not compatible with receiver state".
If the ERROR INDICATION message is sent connectionless, the CN Domain Indicator IE shall be present.
If the ERROR INDICATION message is sent connectionless towards the CN, the Global RNC-ID IE shall be present.
When an ERROR INDICATION message is sent connectionless from a CN node towards an RNC for which the sending CN node is not the default CN node, the Global CN-ID IE shall be included.

The RNC initiates the procedure by sending a RESET RESOURCE message to the CN.
The RESET RESOURCE message shall include the CN Domain Indicator IE, the Global RNC-ID IE, the Cause IE with the appropriate cause value (e.g. "Signalling Transport Resource Failure") and a list containing Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IEs.
On reception of this message the CN shall release locally the resources and references (i.e. resources and Iu signalling connection identifiers) associated to the Iu signalling connection identifiers indicated in the received message. The CN shall always return the RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the RNC when all Iu-related resources and references have been released and shall include the CN Domain Indicator IE and a list of Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IEs. The list of Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IEs within the RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message shall be in the same order as received in the RESET RESOURCE message. Unknown signalling connection identifiers shall be reported as released.
When a RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message is sent from a CN node towards an RNC for which the sending CN node is not the default CN node, the Global CN-ID IE shall be included.
Both the CN and the RNC shall provide means to prevent the immediate re-assignment of released Iu signalling connection identifiers to minimise the risk that the Reset Resource procedure releases the same Iu signalling connection identifiers re-assigned to new Iu connections.
8.29.2.2	Reset Resource procedure initiated from the CN

Figure 35: CN initiated Reset Resource procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a RESET RESOURCE message to the RNC.
The RESET RESOURCE message shall include the CN Domain Indicator IE, the Cause IE with the appropriate cause value (e.g. "Signalling Transport Resource Failure") and a list containing Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IEs.
When a RESET RESOURCE message is sent from a CN node towards an RNC for which the sending CN node is not the default CN node, the Global CN-ID IE shall be included.
On reception of this message the RNC shall release locally the resources and references (i.e. radio resources and Iu signalling connection identifiers) associated to the specific CN node and Iu signalling connection identifiers indicated in the received message. The Global RNC-ID IE shall not be included in the RESET RESOURCE message. If no Global CN-ID IE is included in the RESET RESOURCE message to indicate the sending CN node, the default CN node for the indicated CN domain shall be considered as sender. The RNC shall always return the RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the CN when all Iu-related resources and references have been released and shall include the CN Domain Indicator IE, a list of Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IEs and the Global RNC-ID IE. The list of Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IEs within the RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message shall be in the same order as received in the RESET RESOURCE message. Unknown signalling connection identifiers shall be reported as released.
Both the RNC and the CN shall provide means to prevent the immediate re-assignment of released Iu signalling connection identifiers to minimise the risk that the Reset Resource procedure releases the same Iu signalling connection identifiers re-assigned to new Iu connections.

The RNC initiates the procedure by generating a RAB MODIFY REQUEST message towards the CN and shall include a list of RABs To Be Modified IEs. For each RAB requested to be modified the RABs To Be Modified Item IE of the RAB MODIFY REQUEST message shall include the RAB ID IE, and the corresponding Requested RAB Parameter Values IE. The Requested RAB Parameter Values IE shall either list those RAB parameters the RNC would like modified and the associated new RAB parameter values it is requesting or shall indicate that the execution of the alternative RAB configuration is requested. For any given RAB, the RNC shall be able to propose modifications to any negotiable RAB parameters.
If the requested maximum bit rate (respectively the requested guaranteed bit rate when applicable) exceeds the maximum value of the Requested Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate IE), either the Extended Requested Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) shall be used or the Supported Requested Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) shall be used.
For a RAB if Extended Requested Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate IE when applicable) is signalled in one direction RNC shall signal the Extended Requested Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Extended Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) also in the other direction for this RAB. If Supported Requested Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) is used it shall be used in both directions.
If supported the RNC may include the Supported Requested Maximum Bit Rate IE (respectively Supported Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate IE) in Requested RAB Parameter Values IE to define the RAB parameters the RNC would like modified and the associated new RAB parameter values.
If the RNC is allowed to request an alternative RAB Configuration, the RNC may request the CN to trigger the execution of this alternative RAB configuration by including the Alternative RAB Configuration Request IE in the RAB MODIFY REQUEST message.
Upon reception of the RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, it is up to the CN to decide how to react to the request.

When the transferred information is of RIM nature, the RIM Information IE within the RIM Transfer IE shall contain a BSSGP RIM PDU. The RIM Routing Address IE shall not be present since the RNC is the final destination node.
8.34.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.35	Uplink Information Exchange
8.35.1	General
The purpose of the Uplink Information Exchange procedure is to transfer or request some information to the CN.
This procedure uses connectionless signalling.
8.35.2	Successful Operation

Figure 44: Uplink Information Exchange procedure. Successful operation.
The procedure is initiated with an UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message sent from the RNC to the CN.
The UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message shall contain the following IEs:
-	Information Exchange ID
- 	Information Exchange Type
-	CN Domain Indicator
-	Global RNC-ID
The Information Exchange Type IE indicates whether the RNC asks the CN to either transfer or request specific information. If the Information Exchange Type IE is set to the value "transfer", the RNC shall also include in the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message the Information Transfer Type IE which indicates the nature of the information transferred.
If the Information Exchange Type IE is set to the value "request", the RNC shall also include in the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message the Information Request Type IE which indicates the nature of the information requested.
When the transferred information in the Information Transfer Type IE relates to a Trace Session in the RNC, the Trace Activation Indicator IE indicates whether the Trace Session identified by the Trace Reference IE is activated or deactivated in the RNC. In case the Trace Session is activated, the Equipments To Be Traced IE gives the Equipment Identity of the UEs that the RNC has to trace. If the Trace Recording Session Reference IE, Trace Collection Entity IP Address IE, the IMSI IE and optionally the Serving Cell Identifier IE are included in the message, the CN shall take the information into account for anonymization of MDT data (TS 32.422 [10]).
When the requested information in the Information Request Type IE relates to the Multicast Service list for a given UE identified by its Permanent NAS UE Identity in the Information Request Type IE, this requested information, i.e. the list of Multicast Services the UE has joined, shall be included in the Information Requested IE in the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message.
When the requested information in the Information Request Type IE relates to the IP Multicast Address and APN for one or several MBMS bearer service identified by their respective TMGIs in the Information Request Type IE, this requested information, i.e. IP Multicast Address and APN, shall be included in the Information Requested IE in the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message.
If the CN node is capable of processing the request or the transfer, the RNC shall be informed by the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message. The UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message shall contain the Information Exchange ID IE and the CN Domain Indicator IE. If the RNC has not sent the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message to the default CN node, the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message shall also include the Global CN-ID IE.
Upon reception of the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message including the IP Multicast Address and APN list in the Information Requested IE, the RNC shall store this information in the relevant MBMS Service Contexts.
Upon reception of the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message including the Multicast Service list in the Information Requested IE, the RNC shall perform, for each TMGI received, the corresponding UE linking as described in TS 25.346 [42].

8.35.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not Applicable.
8.36	MBMS Session Start
8.36.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Start procedure is to request the UTRAN to notify UEs about an upcoming MBMS Session of a given MBMS Bearer Service and to establish a MBMS RAB and MBMS Iu signalling connection for this MBMS Session. The MBMS Session Start procedure is triggered by the CN (PS domain).
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.36.2	Successful Operation

Figure 46: MBMS Session Start procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS SESSION START message.
The MBMS SESSION START message shall contain:
-	TMGI;
-	MBMS Bearer Service Type;
-	MBMS Session Identity, if available;
-	Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IE;
-	RAB parameters (including e.g. Allocation/Retention Priority);
-	PDP Type Information, if available; 
-	PDP Type Information extension, if available;
-	MBMS Session Duration;
-	MBMS Service Area;
-	Frequency Layer Convergence Flag, if available;
-	RA List of Idle Mode UEs, if available;
-	Global CN-ID IE, only when the MBMS SESSION START message is sent from a CN node towards an RNC for which the sending CN node is not the default CN node;
-	MBMS Session Repetition Number, if available;
-	Time to MBMS Data Transfer;
-	MBMS Counting Information, if available.
Upon reception of the MBMS SESSION START message, the RNC shall store the Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IE for the duration of the MBMS Iu signalling connection. The Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IE contains an Iu signalling connection identifier which is allocated by the CN. The value for the Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IE shall be allocated so as to uniquely identify an Iu signalling connection for the involved CN node.
The Global CN-ID IE contains the identity of the CN node that sent the MBMS SESSION START message, and it shall, if included, be stored together with the Iu signalling connection identifier. If the Global CN-ID IE is not included, the MBMS SESSION START message shall be considered as coming from the default CN node.
Upon reception of the MBMS SESSION START message, the RNC shall store, if not already, and remember the TMGI IE, the RAB parameters IE and the other attributes of the session as part of the MBMS Service Context. The TMGI IE contains the TMGI identifier which uniquely identifies the MBMS Bearer Service.
If the RNC receives the MBMS SESSION START message including the Session Re-establishment Indicator IE for a service which is already ongoing, it shall, if supported, accept this message and replace the MBMS context for that service (see TS 23.007 [53]).
If the MBMS Bearer Service Type IE is set to "Multicast", upon reception of the MBMS SESSION START message, the RNC shall initiate allocation of requested resources for the MBMS RAB at a proper point in time if at least one of the following two conditions is fulfilled:
-	the RNC controls at least one cell contained in the indicated MBMS Service Area and, if the RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE is included in MBMS SESSION START message, at least one RNC´s RA is contained in this list, or if Empty/Full RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE included in MBMS SESSION START message is set to "fulllist",
-	the RNC serves UEs consuming radio resources from cells contained in the indicated MBMS Service Area.
If no mapping is configured for a certain MBMS Service Area Identity in the MBMS Service Area IE in the RNC it shall simply ignore it
The RNC may optimise the point in time when the resource allocation is initiated based on the Time to MBMS Data Transfer IE.
In case the RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE is included in MBMS SESSION START message but none of above conditions is fulfilled, the RNC may decide to wait for either an update of the RA List of Idle Mode UEs or a UE linking to finally establish the MBMS RAB. If the RNC decides so, it shall report it immediately to the CN in the MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message with the cause value "Successful MBMS Session Start - No Data Bearer Necessary" and maintain an Iu signalling connection.
If the Empty/Full RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE included in MBMS SESSION START message is set to "fulllist", the RNC shall initiate the MBMS Notification over the Uu interface in all the cells under its control which belong to the indicated MBMS service area.
If the MBMS Bearer Service Type IE is set to "Broadcast", the MBMS Counting Information IE shall be included in the MBMS SESSION START message. If the MBMS Counting Information IE is set to "counting", the RNC may apply MBMS counting.
If the MBMS Bearer Service Type IE is set to "Broadcast" upon reception of the MBMS SESSION START message, the RNC shall initiate allocation of requested resources for the MBMS RAB at a proper point in time if it controls at least one cell contained in the indicated MBMS Service Area.
If the MBMS Bearer Service Type IE is set to "Multicast" the MBMS Counting Information IE shall be ignored.
The allocation of requested resources shall be made according to the values of the Allocation/Retention Priority IE (priority level, pre-emption indicators) and the resource situation as follows:
-	The RNC shall consider the priority level of the requested MBMS RAB, when deciding on the resource allocation.
-	The Queuing Allowed IE shall be ignored for MBMS RAB.
-	The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (singularly or in combination) be used to determine whether the MBMS RAB establishment has to be performed unconditionally and immediately. If the requested MBMS RAB is marked as "may trigger pre-emption" and the resource situation requires so, the RNC may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced release of a lower priority RAB which is marked as "pre-emptable". Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption procedure is operator-dependent, the pre-emption indicators, if given in the MBMS SESSION START message, shall be treated as follows:
1.	If the Pre-emption Capability IE is set to "may trigger pre-emption", then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption procedure. UTRAN shall only pre‑empt RABs (other MBMS RABs or UE specific RABs) with lower priority, in ascending order of priority.
2.	If the Pre-emption Capability IE is set to "shall not trigger pre-emption", then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption procedure.
3.	If the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE is set to "pre-emptable", then this connection shall be included in the pre-emption process.
4.	If the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE is set to "not pre-emptable", then this connection shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
5.	If the Priority Level IE is set to "no priority" the given values for the Pre-emption Capability IE and Pre-emption Vulnerability IE shall not be considered. Instead the values "shall not trigger pre-emption" and "not pre-emptable" shall prevail.
-	If the Allocation/Retention Priority IE is not given in the MBMS SESSION START message, the allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption process and the connection may be pre-empted and considered to have the value "lowest" as priority level. Moreover, queuing shall not be allowed.
The UTRAN shall use the PDP Type Information IE or PDP Type Information extension IE to configure any compression algorithms.
The MBMS SESSION START message may contain the MBMS Synchronisation Information IE, consisting of the
-	MBMS HC Indicator IE;
-	IP Multicast Address IE;
-	GTP DL TEID IE;
-	IP Source Address IE, if available.
In case of successful MBMS RAB establishment, if the MBMS Synchronisation Information IE was not received within the MBMS SESSION START message, the RNC shall include the Transport Layer Address IE and the Iu Transport Association IE in the MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message. The RNC may answer successfully even though the MBMS resources have not been established in all relevant cells.
If NNSF is active, the RNC may receive from several CN nodes for a certain MBMS Bearer Service the MBMS SESSION START message. In this case, if the RNC decides to establish the requested MBMS RAB, it shall only establish one MBMS Iu bearer and shall inform the selected CN node accordingly i.e. with MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message including the Transport Layer Address IE and the Iu Transport Association IE.
If the MBMS Synchronisation Information IE was received within the MBMS SESSION START message, even if the RNC received related information more than once due to NNSF, if supported, it shall not include the Transport Layer Address IE and the Iu Transport Association IE in the MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message and shall join the indicated IP Multicast group only once for the indicated MBMS Service Id. In case of successful joining the indicated IP Multicast group, the RNC shall inform all the CN nodes from which it has received a MBMS SESSION START message for that MBMS service with the Cause IE set to "Successful MBMS Session Start – IP Multicast Bearer established". If the IP Source Address IE is contained in the MBMS Synchronisation Information IE, the RNC shall use this information for joining the IP Multicast group.
If the RNC receives from several CN nodes for a certain MBMS Bearer Service the MBMS SESSION START message and all the MBMS SESSION START messages include the RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE and does not include the Session Re-establishment Indicator IE, the RNC shall, if supported, maintain an MBMS Iu signalling connection towards all the CN nodes and inform them accordingly i.e. with MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message and cause value "Successful MBMS Session Start - No Data Bearer Necessary" to all the CN nodes except the one, if any, towards which the RNC confirmed the successful MBMS RAB establishment.
The MBMS Session Repetition Number IE may be included in the MBMS SESSION START message in case the MBMS Session Identity IE is included in the same message. The MBMS Session Repetition Number IE may be used by RNC to recognise retransmissions of a particular session of a MBMS Bearer Service with identical contents. This IE may be used for counting purpose.
When the Frequency Layer Convergence Flag IE is set to "no-FLC-flag", the RNC is being requested to not apply any frequency layer convergence mechanism. The service shall then be delivered to all cells of all the MBMS Service Area Identities indicated in the MBMS Service Area IE.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
8.36.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 47: MBMS Session Start procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the RNC is not capable of correctly processing the request (e.g. the MBMS resources could not be established at all in any cell), the CN shall be informed by the MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message.
If the MBMS Bearer Service Type IE is set to "Broadcast" upon reception of the MBMS SESSION START message and the RNC doesn’t have any cell contained in the indicated MBMS Service Area, it shall report it immediately to the CN in the MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message with the cause value "MBMS - No cell in MBMS Service Area".
If NNSF is active and the RNC received from several CN nodes for a certain MBMS Bearer Service the MBMS SESSION START message, but not all of the MBMS SESSION START messages include the RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE, the RNC shall inform the respective CN nodes accordingly i.e. with MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message and cause value "MBMS - Superseded Due To NNSF" to all the CN nodes except the one towards which the RNC confirmed the successful MBMS RAB establishment with MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message.
When UTRAN reports failure of the MBMS Session Start procedure, the cause value should be precise enough to enable the core network to know the reason for the failure. Typical cause values are: "MBMS - Superseded Due To NNSF", "Requested Traffic Class not Available", "Invalid RAB Parameters Value", "Requested Maximum Bit Rate not Available", "Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate not Available", "Requested Transfer Delay not Achievable", "Invalid RAB Parameters Combination", "Condition Violation for Guaranteed Bit Rate", "Iu Transport Connection Failed to Establish", "No Resource Available".
Transmission and reception of a MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
8.36.4	Abnormal Conditions
If, for a MBMS RAB requested to be set up, the PDP Type Information IE and/or PDP Type Information extension IE is not present, the RNC shall continue with the procedure.
If an MBMS SESSION START message from a given CN Node provides a TMGI IE that is used for an already established and running MBMS Session provided by the same CN Node, and the indicated MBMS Service Area IE refers to an MBMS Service Area that is partially or completely overlapping with the MBMS Service Area of the already established and running MBMS Session, and the Session Re-establishment Indicator IE is not included in the MBMS SESSION START message, then the RNC shall return an MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message with the cause value "TMGI in Use and overlapping MBMS Service Area ".
If an MBMS SESSION START message from a given CN Node provides a TMGI IE that is used for an already established and running MBMS Session provided by another CN Node, and the indicated MBMS Service Area IE refers to a different MBMS Service Area that is partially overlapping with the MBMS Service Area of the already established and running MBMS Session, and the Session Re-establishment Indicator IE is not included in the MBMS SESSION START message, then the RNC shall return an MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message with the cause value "TMGI in Use and overlapping MBMS Service Area ".
8.37	MBMS Session Update
8.37.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Update procedure is to inform the RNC during a MBMS Session whenever the RA List of Idle Mode UEs changes compared to one previously sent. The MBMS Session Update procedure is triggered by the CN (PS domain).
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.37.2	Successful Operation

Figure 48: MBMS Session Update procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS SESSION UPDATE message.
The MBMS SESSION UPDATE message shall contain the Delta RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE and the Session Update ID IE.
Upon reception of the MBMS SESSION UPDATE message, if a MBMS RAB has already been established, the RNC shall initiate allocation of additional MBMS radio resources for this MBMS RAB if the RNC controls at least one cell that is part of both the MBMS Service Area and one of the RNC´s RAs indicated in the New RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE, if this IE is included in the Delta RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE group. The RNC may release the existing MBMS radio resources for the cells part of the RNC’s RAs indicated in the RA List with No Idle Mode UEs Any More IE, if this IE is included in the Delta RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE group.
Upon reception of the MBMS SESSION UPDATE message, if no MBMS RAB has yet been established, the RNC shall establish the MBMS RAB if the RNC controls at least one cell that is part of both the MBMS Service Area and one of the RNC´s RAs indicated in the New RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE, if this IE is included in the Delta RA List of Idle Mode UEs IE group. If the previous condition is not fulfilled, the RNC may decide to wait for either another update of the RA List of Idle Mode UEs or a UE linking to finally establish the MBMS RAB.
In case of successful MBMS RAB establishment, the RNC shall include the Transport Layer Address IE and the Iu Transport Association IE in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message.
When the update of the RA List of Idle Mode UEs is successfully executed, the UTRAN shall report it to the CN in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message, which shall include the same Session Update ID IE as received in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE message. The RNC may answer successfully even though MBMS resources have not been established in all relevant cells.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
8.37.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 49: MBMS Session Update procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the RNC is not capable of correctly processing the request (e.g. additional MBMS resources could not be established at all in any cell), the CN shall be informed by the MBMS SESSION UDATE FAILURE message, which shall include the same Session Update ID IE as received in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE message.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS SESSION UPDATE FAILURE message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
8.37.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.38	MBMS Session Stop
8.38.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Stop procedure is to request the UTRAN to notify UEs about the end of a given MBMS Session and to release the corresponding MBMS RAB and MBMS Iu signalling connection for this MBMS Session. The MBMS RAB Session Stop procedure may also be used as the last MBMS session stop to make the RNC aware that a certain Multicast Service is no longer available. The MBMS Session Stop procedure is triggered by the CN (PS domain).
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.38.2	Successful Operation

Figure 50: MBMS Session Stop procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS SESSION STOP message.
Upon reception of the MBMS SESSION STOP message, the RNC shall release all allocated resources for the MBMS RAB, including the MBMS Iu signalling connection used for this MBMS RAB.
The MBMS SESSION STOP message shall include the MBMS CN De-Registration IE. If the MBMS CN De-Registration IE is set to the value "deregister", the RNC shall also remove all associated MBMS Service Context(s) and release all allocated MBMS resources for the MBMS Bearer Service.
The RNC does not need to wait for the release of all UTRAN radio resources before returning the MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE message.
In case of successful release of the MBMS Iu signalling connection, after the MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE message has been sent, the CN shall not send further RANAP connection-oriented messages on this particular connection.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
8.38.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.39	MBMS UE Linking
8.39.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS UE Linking procedure is to make the RNC aware that a given UE, with existing Iu-ps signalling connection, joined and/or left one or several Multicast Services.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.39.2	Successful Operation

Figure 51: MBMS UE Linking procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message.
The MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message shall contain the following IEs:
-	a list of one or several TMGIs, each identifying the MBMS Bearer Service that the UE joined or left and which has not yet been linked or unlinked respectively in the UTRAN;
-	for each of the MBMS Bearer Services that the UE joined;
-	the PTP RAB ID.
Upon reception of the MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message, for each TMGI received identifying the MBMS Bearer Service that the UE joined and which has not yet been linked in the UTRAN, the RNC shall perform the corresponding UE linking as described in TS 25.346 [42].
Upon reception of the MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message, for each TMGI received identifying the MBMS Bearer Service that the UE left and which has not yet been de-linked in the UTRAN, the RNC shall perform the corresponding UE de-linking as described in TS 25.346 [42].
After handling all received TMGI(s), the RNC shall only report to the CN in the MBMS UE LINKING RESPONSE message the unsuccessful linking(s)/de-linking(s) with an appropriate cause value e.g. "MBMS - UE Linking Already Done", "MBMS - UE De-Linking Failure - No Existing UE Linking".
Transmission and reception of a MBMS UE LINKING RESPONSE message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
8.39.3	Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation for this Class 1 Elementary procedure is described under the Successful Operation chapter.
8.39.4	Abnormal Conditions
Upon reception of the MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message, if for a given TMGI received identifying the MBMS Bearer Service that the UE joined, the linking has already been done in the UTRAN, the RNC shall consider this linking as unsuccessful but shall proceed with the other ones.
Upon reception of the MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message, if a given TMGI received identifying the MBMS Bearer Service that the UE left, cannot be found in the UE context, the RNC shall consider this de-linking as unsuccessful but shall proceed with the other ones.
8.40	MBMS Registration
8.40.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Registration procedure is to request the CN (PS domain) to register or de-register the RNC for a certain Multicast Service.
The procedure uses connectionless signalling, unless the procedure is used to request CN to de-register the RNC for a Multicast Service which has an existing Iu signalling connection towards the RNC i.e. during a MBMS Session. In this last case, the procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.40.2	Successful Operation

Figure 52: MBMS Registration procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
The MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message shall contain the following IEs:
-	MBMS Registration Request type;
-	TMGI;
-	The associated IP Multicast Address and the APN corresponding to the MBMS Bearer Service identified by the TMGI, only in the case the MBMS Registration Request type IE is set to "register";
-	Global RNC-ID, if connectionless signalling.
If the CN node is capable of processing the request, the RNC shall be informed by the MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message.
In case of connectionless signalling the MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message shall contain the same TMGI as received in the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the RNC has not sent the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the MBMS Registration Request Type IE set to "register", to the default CN node, the MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message shall also include the Global CN-ID IE.
Upon reception of the MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message as a response to a connectionless MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the MBMS Registration Request Type IE set to "deregister", the RNC shall remove all associated MBMS resources and context(s) corresponding to the MBMS Bearer Service identified by the TMGI included in the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
Upon reception of the MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message as a response to a connection oriented MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the MBMS Registration Request Type IE set to "deregister", the RNC shall release the MBMS Iu signalling connection and the RAB, if any, identified by the TMGI included in the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message terminate the procedure in the CN and in the UTRAN respectively.
8.40.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 53: MBMS Registration procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the CN node is not capable of correctly processing the request, the RNC shall be informed by the MBMS REGISTRATION FAILURE message.
In case of connectionless signalling, the MBMS REGISTRATION FAILURE message shall contain the same TMGI as received in the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
The MBMS REGISTRATION FAILURE message shall inform the RNC about the reason for unsuccessful operation thank to appropriate cause value e.g. "TMGI Unknown", "IP Multicast Address And APN Not Valid", "MBMS De-Registration Rejected Due To Implicit Registration", "MBMS - Request Superseded", "MBMS De-Registration During Session Not Allowed".
In case of connectionless signalling, if the RNC has not sent the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the MBMS Registration Request Type IE set to "register", to the default CN node, the MBMS REGISTRATION FAILURE message shall also include the Global CN-ID IE.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS REGISTRATION FAILURE message terminate the procedure in the CN and in the UTRAN respectively.
8.40.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.41	MBMS CN De-Registration
8.41.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS CN De-Registration procedure is to make the RNC aware that a certain Multicast Service is no longer available. The MBMS CN De-Registration procedure is triggered by the CN (PS domain).
The procedure uses connectionless signalling.
8.41.2	Successful Operation

Figure 54: MBMS CN De-Registration procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
The MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message shall contain the following IEs:
-	TMGI;
-	Global CN-ID IE, only when the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message is sent from a CN node towards an RNC for which the sending CN node is not the default CN node.
If the Global CN-ID IE is not included, the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message shall be considered as coming from the default CN node.
Upon reception of the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the RNC shall remove all associated MBMS context(s) and resources corresponding to the MBMS Bearer Service identified by the indicated TMGI and shall report it to the CN by sending the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message.
Upon reception of the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message, if no existing MBMS Bearer Service can be identified by the indicated TMGI in the RNC, it shall consider this MBMS CN De-Registration procedure unsuccessful and shall report it to the CN by sending the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message with the appropriate cause value e.g. "TMGI unknown".
The MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message shall contain the Global RNC-ID IE and the same TMGI as received in the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
8.41.3	Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation for this Class 1 Elementary procedure is described under the Successful Operation chapter.
8.41.4	Abnormal Conditions
If NNSF is active, the RNC may receive from several CN nodes for a certain MBMS Bearer Service the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message. In this case the RNC will only proceed with the first MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message received and will inform the respective CN nodes accordingly i.e. with MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message and cause value "TMGI unknown" to all the CN nodes except the one towards which the RNC confirmed the successful the MBMS CN De-Registration procedure with MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message including no cause value.
8.42	MBMS RAB Establishment Indication
8.42.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS RAB Establishment Indication procedure is to inform the CN (PS domain) of the establishment of the MBMS RAB corresponding to the MBMS Iu signalling connection used for this procedure.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.42.2	Successful Operation

Figure 55: MBMS RAB Establishment Indication procedure. Successful operation.
When the RNC has not yet established the MBMS RAB for a particular Multicast Service and is informed that a given UE joined this particular Multicast Service, the RNC shall initiate the MBMS RAB Establishment Indication procedure and send the MBMS RAB ESTABLISHMENT INDICATION message to the CN. If NNSF is active, the selection of the CN node is implementation dependant.
The MBMS RAB ESTABLISHMENT INDICATION message shall include the Transport Layer Address IE and the Iu Transport Association IE.
8.42.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.43	MBMS RAB Release
8.43.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS RAB Release procedure is to enable the UTRAN to request the release of an MBMS RAB. The MBMS RAB is defined for the PS domain only.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.43.2	Successful Operation

Figure 56: MBMS RAB Release procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by generating a MBMS RAB RELEASE REQUEST message towards the CN. The MBMS RAB RELEASE REQUEST message is sent on the Iu connection related to the MBMS RAB to be released. The included cause value indicates the reason for the release, e.g. "RAB pre-empted", "Release due to UTRAN Generated Reason", "MBMS - No Data Bearer Necessary".
The CN should according to the MBMS RAB RELEASE REQUEST message initiate the release of all MBMS resources related to the Iu connection.
For MBMS Multicast service the Iu signalling connection should not be released.
The RNC may at reception of MBMS RAB RELEASE initiate release of the related MBMS bearer resources.
MBMS Broadcast service, interaction with MBMS Session Stop:
For MBMS Broadcast service the CN may initiate the appropriate release procedure for the MBMS Session related to the Iu signalling connection and invoke the MBMS Session Stop procedure.
8.43.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 57: MBMS RAB RELEASE procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the CN node is not capable of correctly processing the request, the RNC shall be informed by the MBMS RAB RELEASE FAILURE message.
The MBMS RAB RELEASE FAILURE message shall inform the RNC about the reason for the unsuccessful operation with an appropriate cause value.
8.43.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.44	Enhanced Relocation Complete
8.44.1	General
The purpose of the Enhanced Relocation Complete procedure is to inform the CN that the resources have been allocated by the target RNC. The target RNC provides necessary information to the CN to switch the user plane to the target RNC.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
8.44.2	Successful Operation

Figure 58: Enhanced Relocation Complete procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by sending the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE REQUEST message to the CN.
If the RABs Setup List IE in the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE REQUEST message does not include all RABs previously established for the UE, the CN shall consider the non included RABs as implicitly released by the RNC.
For each RAB the resource allocation was successful towards the PS domain or towards the CS domain when an ALCAP is not used, the RNC shall include the Transport Layer Address IE and the Iu Transport Association IE in the RABs Setup List IE in the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE REQUEST message. If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used when allocating the resources, these RAB parameter values shall be included in the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE REQUEST message within the Assigned RAB Parameter Values IE.
NOTE:	If ALCAP is not used, the RNC shall include the same kind of TNL information (i.e. IPv4 or IPv6) as received from the source RNC in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message.
The target RNC shall include the Chosen Integrity Protection Algorithm IE (Chosen Encryption Algorithm IE respectively) within the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE REQUEST message, if, and only if the Integrity Protection Key IE (Ciphering Key IE respectively) was included within the Source RNC To Target RNC Transparent Container IE of the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION message.

9.2	Information Element Definitions
9.2.0	General
Subclause 9.2 presents the RANAP IE definitions in tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.3. In case there is contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

9.2.1.2	RAB ID
This element uniquely identifies a radio access bearer for a specific CN domain for a particular UE, which makes the RAB ID unique over one Iu connection. The RAB ID shall remain the same for the duration of the RAB even when the RAB is relocated to another Iu connection.
The purpose of the element is to bind data stream from the Non Access Stratum point of view (e.g. bearer of call or PDP context) and radio access bearer in Access Stratum. The value is also used in the RNC to relate Radio Bearers to a RAB. The content of this information element is transferred unchanged from the CN node (i.e. MSC or SGSN) via the RNC to the UE by RANAP messages and RRC messages. For RRC messages refer to TS 25.331 [10].
The element contains binary representation of either the Stream Identifier (SI) for CS domain or the Network Service Access Point Identifier (NSAPI) for PS domain. These identifiers are coded in the RAB ID element in accordance with the coding of the Stream Identifier IE and with the coding of the NSAPI IE in TS 24.008 [8].

9.2.1.96	IRAT Measurement Configuration
The IRAT Measurement Configuration IE contains information for instructing the incoming UE to continue measuring the cells of the source RAT after a successful inter-system handover. It is used by the source RAT to specify the minimum radio quality and the period of time measurements should last for triggering a HO report for unnecessary HO to another RAT. A subset of source RAT frequencies to measure may be specified. The measurement bandwidth of a carrier frequency may also be specified in order to improve the measurement accuracy and reduce measurement time. The IRAT Measurement Configuration IE shall contain at least one of the RSRP or RSRQ thresholds. If only one of the thresholds is present, the target RAT will use the present threshold to compare against the measurement results received from the UE. HO Report should be sent if there is either a single source RAT cell whose measurement results exceed the threshold for the whole measurement duration, or a group of source RAT cells together provide such coverage. The cells that exceed the threshold in the first UE measurement report are included in the HO Report. If both thresholds are present, the received radio measurements must exceed both the RSRP and the RSRQ thresholds in order to satisfy the indicated radio conditions.
When the HO Report is sent from RNC at the end of the configured measurement duration, it shall set the HO Report Type IE to "Unnecessary HO to another RAT". If the measurement period expires due to an inter-RAT handover towards LTE executed within the configured measurement duration, the RNC shall set the HO Report Type IE in the HO Report to "Early IRAT Handover".
No HO Report shall be sent in case no E-UTRAN cell could be included, or if the indicated period of time is interrupted by an inter-RAT handover to a RAT different than LTE or by an intra-UMTS handover with SRNC relocation.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.0	General
RANAP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.680 [14] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [15].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of RANAP messages. RANAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct a RANAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions..
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE:	“IE” means an IE in the object set with an explicit id. If one IE needed to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE IDs.
If a RANAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
Subclause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of RANAP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this subclause and the tabular format in subclause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
9.3.1	Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor interoperability;
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.

10	Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
10.1	General
Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:
-	Transfer Syntax Error.
-	Abstract Syntax Error.
-	Logical Error.
Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving node:

Figure 10.1: Protocol Errors in RANAP.
The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included in the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be included. Other optional information elements within the message may also be included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the reporting is done with a response message. The latter is an exception to what is stated in subclause 4.1.
10.2	Transfer Syntax Error
A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode the received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always detected in the process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error occurs, the receiver should initiate Error Indication procedure with appropriate cause value for the Transfer Syntax protocol error.
Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:
-	Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. e.g.: If an IE has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and 12 will be received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax error.
-	Violation in list element constraints. e.g.: If a list is defined as containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, than this case will be handled as a transfer syntax error.
-	Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the originator of the message).
-	Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the originator of the message).
10.3	Abstract Syntax Error
10.3.1	General
An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional RANAP entity:
1.	receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE ID);
2.	receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g.: ASN.1 definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10 (values 11 to 15 are undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an abstract syntax error using criticality information sent by the originator of the message);
3.	does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence of the concerning object, the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the received message.
4.	receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group;
5.	receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the concerning object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE groups should not have been present in the received message.
Cases 1 and 2 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on received Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is handled based on Criticality information and Presence information for the missing IE/IE group specified in the version of the specification used by the receiver. Case 4 (IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences) and Case 5 (erroneously present conditional IEs or IE groups) result in rejecting the procedure.
If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the remaining message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error that belong to cases 1-3 act according to the Criticality Information and Presence Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract Syntax Error occurred in accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is specified in subclause 10.3.6.
10.3.2	Criticality Information
In the RANAP messages there is criticality information set for individual IEs and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver how to act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended, i.e. the entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully or partially) comprehended shall be treated in accordance with its own criticality information as specified in subclause 10.3.4.
In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing IE/IE group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).
The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the Criticality Information. The three possible values of the Criticality Information for an IE/IE group are:
-	Reject IE.
-	Ignore IE and Notify Sender.
-	Ignore IE.
The following rules restrict when a receiving entity may consider an IE, an IE group, or an EP not comprehended (not implemented), and when action based on criticality information is applicable:
1.	IE or IE group: When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, then other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered comprehended by a receiving entity (some may still remain unsupported).
2.	EP: The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not supported may be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from that standard version is comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.
10.3.3	Presence Information
For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1 transfer syntax, RANAP specifies separately if the presence of these IEs/IE groups is optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application by means of the presence field of the concerning object of class RANAP-PROTOCOL-IES, RANAP-PROTOCOL-IES-PAIR, RANAP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or RANAP-PRIVATE-IES.
The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:
1.	Optional;
2.	Conditional;
3.	Mandatory.
If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence of the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the condition is true according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE group.
If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of the IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE group.

10.3.6	IEs or IE groups received in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present
If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional presence are present when the condition is not met (i.e. erroneously present), the receiving node shall behave according to the following:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value "Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)" using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure, and use cause value "Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)".
-	If a response message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the specification version used by the receiver shall be considered.
10.4	Logical Error
Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly, but the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e. semantic error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with the state of the receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour shall be performed (unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class of the elementary procedure, irrespective of the criticality information of the IEs/IE groups containing the erroneous values.
Class 1:
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1 procedure, and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. Typical cause values are:
-	Semantic Error.
-	Message not compatible with receiver state.
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1 procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure Code IE and the Triggering Message IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
Class 2:
Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure Code IE and the Triggering Message IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
Class 3:
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 3 procedure, and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. Typical cause values are:
-	Semantic Error.
-	Message not compatible with receiver state.
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 3 procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure Code IE and the Triggering Message IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 3 procedure, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
10.5	Exceptions
The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take precedence over any other error handling described in the other subclauses of clause 10.
-	If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local error handling.
-	In case a response message or Error Indication message needs to be returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
-	If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause value shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality "ignore and notify" have earlier occurred within the same procedure.
11	Special Procedures for RNC to RNC Communication
11.1	General
This subclause specifies special procedures that are used for RNC to RNC communication, and that use other transport means than the RANAP procedures specified in clause 8.
11.2	RANAP Relocation Information
11.2.1	General
The purpose of the RANAP Relocation Information procedure is to handle the RANAP-related information that is carried transparently during relocation from a source RNC to a target RNC by RNSAP via the Iur Interface.
11.2.2	Operation
When during relocation it becomes necessary in the source RNC to generate RANAP information for transfer to the relocation target, the RNC shall form a RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message. The message shall be encoded according to the encoding rules specified for RANAP in the similar manner as for the normal RANAP messages. The outcome of the encoding will be an octet string, which shall not be sent to the CN via the Iu Interface, but shall be given to the appropriate local process for transparent transfer to the target RNC.
When the RANAP process in the target RNC receives an octet string containing a RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message that had been transparently transferred from the source RNC, it shall decode it according to the encoding rules specified for RANAP. This process is similar to receiving any normal RANAP message. The decoded information shall be passed to the appropriate processes in the RNC.
The RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message may contain the Direct Transfer Information List IE, the RAB Contexts List IE and the Source RNC PDCP context info IE. If present, the Direct Transfer Information List IE shall contain the NAS-PDU IE, the SAPI IE and the CN Domain Indicator IE. If present, the RAB Contexts List IE shall contain for each addressed RAB:
-	the RAB ID IE;
-	if available, the DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	if available, the UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	if available, the DL N-PDU Sequence Number IE;
-	if available, the UL N-PDU Sequence Number IE.
Handling in case of RNSAP Relocation:
In case of RNSAP Relocation for each CS RAB operated in support mode (see TS 25.415 [6] for the definition of “support mode”) the source RNC shall include within the RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message the RNSAP Relocation Parameters IE containing the RAB Parameters List IE which shall include the UP Information IE. For each CS RAB operated in support mode for which the user data frame numbering is based on time the source RNC shall include the Timing Difference UL-DL IE within the UP Information IE.
In case of RNSAP Relocation for each PS RAB for which data volume reporting was configured, the source RNC shall include the RAB Data Volume Reports IE within the RAB Parameters List IE included in the RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message.
In case Location Reporting was configure at the source RNC for periodic reporting and/or report upon change of Service area and/or direct reporting, the source RNC shall include the Location Reporting Transfer Information IE within the RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message. 
The Periodic Reporting Indicator IE within the Location Reporting Transfer Information IE shall be set to “periodic SAI” if periodic reporting is requested and the location information is requested to be a Service Area Identifier, to “periodic Geo” if periodic reporting is requested and the location information is requested to be a geographical area.
The Direct Reporting Indicator IE within the Location Reporting Transfer Information IE shall be set to “direct SAI” if periodic reporting is requested and the location information is requested to be a Service Area Identifier, to “direct Geo” if periodic reporting is requested and the location information is requested to be a geographical area. 
The conditions for the presence of further IEs within the Location Reporting Transfer Information are specified in subclause 8.19.2.
If signalling based trace activation was triggered at the source RNC, the RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION shall contain the UE Identity IE and the Trace Propagation Parameters IE in order to continue tracing at the target RNC accordingly.
11.3	RANAP Enhanced Relocation Information
11.3.1	General
The purpose of the RANAP Enhanced Relocation Information procedure is to handle the RANAP-related information that is carried transparently during enhanced relocation from a source RNC to a target RNC by RNSAP via the Iur Interface.
11.3.2	Operation
When during enhanced relocation it becomes necessary in the source RNC to generate RANAP information for transfer to the relocation target, the source RNC shall form a RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message. The message shall be encoded according to the encoding rules specified for RANAP in the similar manner as for the normal RANAP messages. The outcome of the encoding will be an octet string, which shall be given to the appropriate local process for transparent transfer to the target RNC.
When the RANAP process in the target RNC receives an octet string containing a RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message that had been transparently transferred from the source RNC, it shall decode it according to the encoding rules specified for RANAP. This process is similar to receiving any normal RANAP message. The decoded information shall be passed to the appropriate processes in the RNC.
Upon reception of the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall initiate allocation of requested resources.
The RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message shall contain the following IE:
-	Source RNC To Target RNC Transparent Container IE;
The RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message may contain the following IEs:
-	Old Iu Signalling Connection Identifier CS domain IE; if a connection to the CS domain exists;
-	Old Iu Signalling Connection Identifier PS domain IE; if a connection to the PS domain exists;
-	Global CN-ID for CS, if a connection to the CS domain exist;
-	Global CN-ID for PS, if a connection to the PS domain exist;
-	RABs to be Setup List;

-	CN domain indicator IE;
-	RAB parameters IE;
-	User Plane Information IE;
-	Source Side Iu UL TNL Information IE;
-	Data Volume Reporting Indication IE (only for PS);
-	PDP Type Information IE (only for PS).
For each RAB requested to relocate the message may include the following IEs:

-	Service Handover IE;
-	Alternative RAB Parameter Values IE;
-	E-UTRAN Service Handover IE;
-	PDP Type Information extension IE (may be included if PDP Type Information IE is included).
If the Data Forwarding TNL Information IE is included in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, it indicates Iur UP resources, made available by the source RNC for forwarding of UL user data.
Note:	The Source Side Iu UL TNL Information IE (in contrary to the Data Forwarding TNL Information IE) contains information to enable the target RNC to start transmission of user data towards the CN once the relocations have been successfully executed.
If the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is included in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target side shall, if supported, store the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate data rate of non-GBR traffic for this UE.
The RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message shall contain the information (if any) required by the target RNC to build at least the same set of RABs as existing for the UE before the relocation and therefore the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST may contain the RABs to be SETUP List IE.
The resource allocation actions executed by the target RNC are:
If the Relocation Type IE is set to "UE involved in relocation of SRNS":
-	The target RNC should not accept a requested RAB if the RAB did not exist in the source RNC before the relocation;
-	The target RNC may accept a requested RAB only if the RAB can be supported by the target RNC;
-	Other RABs shall be rejected by the target RNC in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message with an appropriate value in the Cause IE, e.g. "Unable to Establish During Relocation";
-	The target RNC shall include information adapted to the resulting RAB configuration in the target to source RNC transparent container to be included in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message sent to the source RNC;
-	If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used when allocating the resources, these RAB parameter values shall be included in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message within the Assigned RAB Parameter Values IE;
-	If d-RNTI for No IuCS UP IE is contained in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall use this information to configure the resource for the UE over Iur during the relocation.
If the Relocation Type IE is set to "UE not involved in relocation of SRNS":
-	The target RNC shall not accept a requested RAB if the RAB did not exist in the source RNC before the relocation;
-	The target RNC may accept a RAB only if the radio bearer(s) for the RAB either exist(s) already and can be used for the RAB by the target RNC, or do(es) not exist before the relocation but can be established in order to support the RAB in the target RNC;
-	If existing radio bearers are not related to any RAB that is accepted by the target RNC, the radio bearers shall be ignored during the relocation of SRNS and the radio bearers shall be released by the radio interface protocols after completion of relocation of SRNS;
-	Usage of alternative RAB parameter values is not applicable for any relocation of type "UE not involved in relocation of SRNS".
If the UE History Information IE is included in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message and the target RNC is configured to collect the information, the target RNC shall, if supported, collect information defined in the UE History Information IE.
The Global CN ID IE and Old Iu Signalling Identifier IE (for PS and/or for CS) are used by the target RNC to establish new Iu Signalling connection(s) between the target RNC towards the CS and/or PS domain.
The RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message may also include an alternative RAB configuration for a RAB specified in the Alternative RAB configuration IE in the Alternative RAB Parameter Values IE. If Alternative RAB configuration IE for a RAB is included in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target RNC is allowed to use the alternative configuration.
The RNC shall, if supported, use the UESBI-Iu IE when included in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message. If UESBI-Iu IE contains an IMEISV the RNC may use this information to determine the characteristics of the UE for subsequent handling.
If the CN MBMS Linking Information IE is included in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the RNC shall, if supported, use the CN MBMS Linking Information IE to perform suitable UE linking as described in TS 25.346 [42].
If the SNA Access Information IE is contained in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall store this information and use it to determine whether the UE has access to radio resources in the UTRAN. The target RNC shall consider that the UE is authorised to access only the PLMNs identified by the PLMN identity IE in the SNA Access Information IE. If the Authorised SNAs IE is included for a given PLMN (identified by the PLMN identity IE), then the target RNC shall consider that the access to radio resources for the concerned UE is restricted to the LAs contained in the SNAs identified by the SNAC IEs.
If the SNA Access Information IE is not contained in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall consider that no access restriction applies to the UE in the UTRAN.
If the Trace Recording Session Information IE is provided within the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container IE, the Target RNC should store that information to include it in a potential future Trace Record for that UE.
After all necessary resources for accepted RABs including the initialised Iu user plane, are successfully allocated, the target RNC shall send a RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message to the source RNC.
For each RAB successfully setup the RNC shall include the following IEs in the RABs Setup List IE:
-	RAB ID.
For each RAB the target RNC has admitted to execute data forwarding, the target RNC shall include the Data Forwarding Information IE in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message. If no ALCAP is used, the RNC shall include the DL Forwarding Transport Layer Address IE and the DL Forwarding Transport Association IE within the Data Forwarding Information IE in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message.
If applicable, the target RNC shall have executed the initialisation of the user plane mode between the source and the target RNC as requested by the source RNC in the User Plane Mode IE. If the target RNC cannot initialise the requested user plane mode for any of the user plane mode versions in the UP Mode Versions IE according to the rules for initialisation of the respective user plane mode versions, as described in TS 25.415 [6], the target RNC may either decide to not relocate the respective RAB or to omit data forwarding for that RAB.
For each RAB the RNC is not able to setup during the Enhanced Relocation Information procedure, the RNC shall include the CN Domain Indicator IE RAB ID IE and the Cause IE within the RABs Failed To Setup IE. The resources associated with the RABs indicated as failed to set up shall not be released in the source RNC until the relocation is completed. This is in order to make a return to the old configuration possible in case of a failed or cancelled relocation.
The RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message sent to the source RNC shall, if applicable, include the Target RNC To Source RNC Transparent Container IE.
Handling in case of RNSAP Relocation:
In case of RNSAP Relocation for each CS RAB operated in support mode (see TS 25.415 [6] for the definition of “support mode”) the source RNC shall include within the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message the RAB Parameters List IE which shall include the UP Information IE. For each CS RAB operated in support mode for which the user data frame numbering is based on time the source RNC shall include the Timing Difference UL-DL IE within the UP Information IE.
The source RNC shall also include within the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message 
-	the CSG Id IE (if available),
-	the CSG Membership Status IE (if available).
Handling in case of Enhanced Relocation between RNC and hybrid cell:
The source RNC shall also include within the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message the CSG Id IE, if available. If the CSG Id IE is included, the CSG Membership Status IE shall be included as well.
Annex A (informative):
RANAP guidelines
A.1	Rules for building RANAP messages
A.1.1	Rules for RANAP messages that shall contain the CN Domain Indicator IE
Based on the principles described in TS 25.401 [3], the following rules can be deduced:
1)	The following RANAP messages initiating a connection oriented signalling connection shall contain the CN Domain Indicator IE: INITIAL UE MESSAGE message and RELOCATION REQUEST message.
2)	Any RANAP message belonging to class 1 procedures and which uses connectionless signalling shall contain the CN Domain Indicator IE.
3)	The following RANAP messages belonging to class 2 procedures and using connectionless signalling shall contain the CN Domain Indicator IE: PAGING message and ERROR INDICATION message, the OVERLOAD message in DL direction (see chapter 8.25.3.1) may contain the CN Domain Indicator IE.

NOTE 1:	The IEs F, J, and L do not have assigned criticality. The IEs F, J, and L are consequently realised as the ASN.1 type SEQUENCE OF of "ordinary" ASN.1 type, e.g. INTEGER. On the other hand, the repeatable IEs with assigned criticality are realised as the ASN.1 type SEQUENCE OF of an IE object, e.g. ProtocolIE-Container.
For the corresponding ASN.1 layout, see subclause A.2.4.

Annex B (informative):
RANAP Transparent containers content
Transparent containers are used in order to transfer information from one RAN node to another RAN node. Depending on the particular scenario the behaviour of both involved RAN nodes may be either specified according to the same radio system or according to different radio systems. During an inter-system handover the source RAN node has to adapt to the target RAN node and its requirements.
In RANAP, for intra-system relocation and inter-system handover to and from E-UTRAN, there is a single transparent container defined for transporting information from the source to the target RAN node and a single transparent container for transporting information from the target to the source RAN node during relocation/handover preparation: the Source to Target Transparent Container IE and the Target to Source Transparent Container IE, which may carry either UTRAN or E-UTRAN specific information. 
Note:	The definition of generic transparent containers for relocation/handover purposes allows to transport them through the core network in a RAT-agnostic way. Inter-system handover to GERAN is not affected by this scheme.
Therefore the container content is encoded according to the rules which are specified for in the target radio system. In subclause 8.6.2, it is described how the transparent container shall be encoded with respect to the scenario in which it is used.
The table below is showing all possible scenarios and definitions according to which the content of the transparent container shall be encoded. Additionally the reference to the specification defining particular IE is given.
Table B.1: Specification of Transparent Containers referenced in RANAP.

25.413
Inter-system handover to E-UTRAN 
Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container
36.413
Target eNB to Source eNB Transparent Container
36.413

Annex C (informative):
Processing of Transparent Containers at the SGSN
Irrespective of the mobility scenario (inter-RAT or intra-UMTS), the SGSN always processes the Source to Target Transparent Container IE and the Target to Source Transparent Container IE in the following way:
-	The SGSN shall convey to the RNC the information received within
-	the GTPv1-C "UTRAN transparent field" of the "UTRAN Transparent Container" IE across the Gn interface (see subclause 7.7.38 of TS 29.060 [35]), or 
-	the GTPv2 "F-container field" of the "F-Container" IE across the S3/S16 interface (see subclause 8.48 of TS 29.274 [36])
by including it in either the Source to Target Transparent Container IE or the Target to Source Transparent Container of the corresponding RANAP message.
-	The SGSN shall convey to the GTP peer the information received within either the Source to Target Transparent Container IE or the Target to Source Transparent Container IE by including it in
-	the GTPv1-C "UTRAN transparent field" of the "UTRAN Transparent Container" IE across the Gn interface (see subclause 7.7.38 of TS 29.060 [35]), or
-	the GTPv2 "F-container field" of the "F-Container" IE across the S3/S16 interface (see subclause 8.48 of TS 29.274 [36]).
