Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x	the first digit:
1	presented to TSG for information;
2	presented to TSG for approval;
3	or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y	the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z	the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.
1	Scope
The present document specifies the Radio Resource Control protocol for the radio interface between UE and E-UTRAN as well as for the radio interface between RN and E-UTRAN.
The scope of the present document also includes:
-	the radio related information transported in a transparent container between source eNB and target eNB upon inter eNB handover;
-	the radio related information transported in a transparent container between a source or target eNB and another system upon inter RAT handover.
The RRC protocol is also used to configure the radio interface between an IAB-node and its parent nodes as specified in TS 38.300 [106].
2	References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this text, constitute provisions of the present document.
-	References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
-	For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
-	For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document in the same Release as the present document.

4	General
4.1	Introduction
In this specification, (parts of) procedures and messages specified for the UE equally apply to the RN for functionality necessary for the RN. There are also (parts of) procedures and messages which are only applicable to the RN in its communication with the E-UTRAN, in which case the specification denotes the RN instead of the UE. Such RN‑specific aspects are not applicable to the UE.
This specification covers MR-DC i.e. the case in which the UE is configured with resources belonging to another node using NR RAT. The NR related configuration is performed using NR RRC as specified in TS 38.331 [82].
NB-IoT is a non backward compatible variant of E-UTRAN supporting a reduced set of functionality. In this specification, (parts of) procedures and messages specified for the UE equally apply to the UE in NB-IoT. There are also some features and related procedures and messages that are not supported by UEs in NB-IoT.
In particular, the following features are not supported in NB-IoT and corresponding procedures and messages do not apply to the UE in NB-IoT:
-	Connected mode mobility (Handover and measurement reporting);
-	Inter-RAT cell reselection or inter-RAT mobility in connected mode;
-	RRC_INACTIVE;
-	CSG;
-	Relay Node (RN);
-	Carrier Aggregation (CA);
-	Dual connectivity (DC);
-	Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC);
-	PDCP duplication;
-	GBR (QoS);
-	ACB, EAB, SSAC and ACDC;
-	MBMS, except for MBMS via SC-PTM in Idle mode;
-	Measurement logging and reporting for network performance optimisation;
-	Public warning systems e.g. CMAS, ETWS and PWS;
-	Broadcast of positioning assistance data;
-	Real time services (including emergency call);
-	CS services and CS fallback;
-	In-device coexistence;
-	RAN assisted WLAN interworking;
-	Network-assisted interference cancellation/suppression;
-	Sidelink (including direct communication and direct discovery).
NOTE: In regard to mobility, NB-IoT is a separate RAT from E-UTRAN.
In this specification, there are also (parts of) procedures and messages which are only applicable to UEs in NB-IoT, in which case this is stated explicitly.
This specification is organised as follows:
-	clause 4.2 describes the RRC protocol model;
-	clause 4.3 specifies the services provided to upper layers as well as the services expected from lower layers;
-	clause 4.4 lists the RRC functions;
-	clause 5 specifies RRC procedures, including UE state transitions;
-	clause 6 specifies the RRC message in a mixed format (i.e. tabular & ASN.1 together);
-	clause 7 specifies the variables (including protocol timers and constants) and counters to be used by the UE;
-	clause 8 specifies the encoding of the RRC messages;
-	clause 9 specifies the specified and default radio configurations;
-	clause 10 specifies the RRC messages transferred across network nodes;
-	clause 11 specifies the UE capability related constraints and performance requirements.
4.2	Architecture
4.2.1	UE states and state transitions including inter RAT
A UE is in RRC_CONNECTED when an RRC connection has been established or in RRC_INACTIVE (if the UE is connected to 5GC) when RRC connection is suspended. If this is not the case, i.e. no RRC connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE state. The RRC states can further be characterised as follows:
-	RRC_IDLE:
-	A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers;
-	UE controlled mobility;
-	The UE:
-	Monitors a Paging channel to detect incoming calls (by CN paging), system information change, for ETWS capable UEs, ETWS notification, and for CMAS capable UEs, CMAS notification;
-	Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
-	Acquires system information;
-	Performs logging of available measurements together with location and time for logged measurement configured UEs;
-	May perform EDT;
-	May perform transmission using PUR;
-	Performs idle/inactive measurements for idle/inactive measurement configured UEs.
-	RRC_INACTIVE:
-	A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers or by RRC layer;
-	A RAN-based notification area is configured by RRC layer;
-	The UE stores the UE Inactive AS context;
-	The UE:
-	Applies RRC_IDLE procedures unless specified otherwise;
-	Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI and RAN paging using fullI-RNTI;
-	Performs periodic RAN-based notification area update;
-	Performs RAN-based notification area update when moving out of the configured RAN-based notification area.
-	RRC_CONNECTED:
-	Transfer of unicast data to/from UE;
-	At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX;
-	For UEs supporting CA, use of one or more SCells, aggregated with the PCell, for increased bandwidth;
-	For UEs supporting DC, use of one SCG, aggregated with the MCG, for increased bandwidth;
-	For UEs supporting (NG)EN-DC, option to configure one NR SCG in conjunction with the MCG for DRBs and SRBs, for improved performance (SRBs) and increased bandwidth (DRBs);
-	For UEs supporting NE-DC, option to configure one SCG in conjunction with the NR MCG for DRBs and SRBs, for improved performance (SRBs) and increased bandwidth (DRBs);
-	Network controlled mobility, i.e. handover and cell change order with optional network assistance (NACC) to GERAN (not applicable for NB-IoT);
-	The UE:
-	Monitors a Paging channel and/ or System Information Block Type 1 contents to detect system information change, for ETWS capable UEs, ETWS notification, and for CMAS capable UEs, CMAS notification (not applicable for BL UEs, UEs in CE and NB-IoT UEs);
-	Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to determine if data is scheduled for it;
-	For UEs in CE supporting reception of ETWS/CMAS indication in RRC_CONNECTED mode, monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to acquire ETWS notification and/or CMAS notification;
-	Provides channel quality and feedback information (not applicable for NB-IoT);
-	Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting (not applicable for NB-IoT);
-	Acquires system information (not applicable for BL UEs, UEs in CE and NB-IoT UEs), except for ETWS/CMAS reception where applicable.
NOTE:	The term "UE is connected to 5GC" covers the scenarios that the UE is connected to 5GC and the UE is requesting to connect with 5GC.

In addition to the state transitions shown in figures above, there is support for connection release with redirection information from E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED to GERAN, UTRAN, CDMA2000 (HRPD Idle/ 1xRTT Dormant mode) and NR. A UE in RRC_INACTIVE enters RRC_IDLE when it enters another RAT or switches to another CN type.
For NB-IoT, mobility between E-UTRA and UTRAN, GERAN and between E-UTRA and CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD is not supported at AS level and hence only the E-UTRA states depicted in Figure 4.2.1-1 are applicable.
4.2.2	Signalling radio bearers
"Signalling Radio Bearers" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RB) that are used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically, the following SRBs are defined:
-	SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;
-	SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH logical channel;
-	For NB-IoT, SRB1bis is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the activation of security, all using DCCH logical channel;
-	SRB2 is for RRC messages which include logged measurement information as well as for NAS messages and messages which include IAB-DU specific F1-C related information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower-priority than SRB1 and is always configured by E-UTRAN after security activation. SRB2 is not applicable for NB-IoT;
-	SRB4 is for RRC messages which include application layer measurement reporting information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB4 can only be configured by E-UTRAN after security activation. SRB4 is not applicable for NB-IoT.
In downlink piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e. with joint success/ failure) procedure: bearer establishment/ modification/ release. In uplink NAS message piggybacking is used only for transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup.
NOTE 1:	The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.
Once security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2 and SRB4, including those containing NAS or non-3GPP messages, are integrity protected and ciphered by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the NAS messages.
For a UE configured with DC, all RRC messages, regardless of the SRB used and both in downlink and uplink, are transferred via the MCG. In case of EN-DC, after connection establishment NR PDCP may be configured for both SRB1 and SRB2 and if so, these SRBs may be configured as split SRB. In case of NGEN-DC and NE-DC, NR PDCP is always configured. For a split SRB, the UE receives RRC messages via both MCG and NR SCG i.e. handles out of order and duplicate PDUs as specified in TS 38.323 [83]. For a split SRB, the network configures via which cell group(s) the UE sends uplink RRC messages.
NOTE 2:	In case of (NG)EN-DC, SRB3 may be configured for the transfer of some NR RRC messages between UE and SgNB via the NR radio interface, see TS 38.331 [82].
An SRB can be configured with PDCP duplication, either by two logical channels within the same CG (CA duplication) or by two logical channels each within a different CG (DC duplication).

5	Procedures
5.1	General
5.1.1	Introduction
The procedural requirements are structured according to the main functional areas: system information (5.2), connection control (5.3), inter-RAT mobility (5.4) and measurements (5.5). In addition, clause 5.6 covers other aspects e.g. NAS dedicated information transfer, UE capability transfer, clause 5.7 specifies the generic error handling, clause 5.8 covers MBMS (i.e. MBMS service reception via MRB), clause 5.8a covers SC-PTM (i.e. MBMS service reception via SC-MRB), clause 5.9 covers RN-specific procedures and clause 5.10 covers sidelink.
For NB-IoT, only a subset of the above procedural requirements applies: system information (5.2), connection control (5.3), some part of other aspects (5.6), general error handling (5.7), and SC-PTM (5.8a). Clauses inter-RAT mobility (5.4), measurements (5.5), MBMS (5.8), RN procedures (5.9) and Sidelink (5.10) are not applicable in NB-IoT.
5.1.2	General requirements
The UE shall:
1>	process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing of a subsequent message;
NOTE 1:	E-UTRAN may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the UE's response of a previously initiated procedure.
1>	within a clause execute the steps according to the order specified in the procedural description;
1>	consider the term 'radio bearer' (RB) to cover SRBs and DRBs but not MRBs or SC-MRBs unless explicitly stated otherwise;
1>	set the rrc-TransactionIdentifier in the response message, if included, to the same value as included in the received RRC message that triggered the response message;
1>	upon receiving a choice value set to setup:
2>	apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;
1>	upon receiving a choice value set to release:
2>	clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated resources;
NOTE 1a:	Following receipt of choice value set to release, the UE considers the field as if it was never configured.
1>	upon handover to E-UTRA; or
1>	upon receiving an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the fullConfig:
2>	apply the Conditions in the ASN.1 for inclusion of the fields for the DRB/PDCP/RLC setup during the reconfiguration of the DRBs included in the drb-ToAddModList;
NOTE 2:	At each point in time, the UE keeps a single value for each field except for during handover when the UE temporarily stores the previous configuration so it can revert back upon handover failure. In other words: when the UE reconfigures a field, the existing value is released except for during handover.
NOTE 3:	Although not explicitly stated, the UE initially considers all functionality to be deactivated/ released until it is explicitly stated that the functionality is setup/ activated. Correspondingly, the UE initially considers lists to be empty e.g. the list of radio bearers, the list of measurements.
1>	upon receiving an extension field comprising the entries in addition to the ones carried by the original field (regardless of whether E-UTRAN may signal more entries in total); apply the following generic behaviour if explicitly stated to be applicable:
2>	create a combined list by concatenating the additional entries included in the extension field to the original field while maintaining the order among both the original and the additional entries;
2>	for the combined list, created according to the previous, apply the same behaviour as defined for the original field;
NOTE 4:	A field comprising a list of entries normally includes 'list' in the field name. The typical way to extend (the size of) such a list is to introduce a field comprising the additional entries, which should include 'listExt' in the name of the field/ IE. E.g. field1List-RAT, field1ListExt-RAT.
1>	consider the term DC to cover the case of an E-UTRA MCG and SCG; Likewise, MCG covers the case of an E-UTRA MCG, SCG covers the case of an E-UTRA SCG, serving cell covers the case of an E-UTRA serving cell, PDCP covers the case of PDCP defined by E-UTRA specifications;
NOTE 5:	In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters configured by E-UTRA RRC unless stated otherwise. Likewise, when a procedure is mentioned, this concerns the procedure defined by E-UTRA RRC unless stated otherwise.
5.1.3	Requirements for UE in MR-DC
In this specification, the UE considers itself to be configured with;
-	EN-DC if and only if it is configured with nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig and it is connected to EPC,
-	NGEN-DC if and only if it is configured with nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig and it is connected to 5GC,
-	NE-DC if and only if it is configured with mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup set to eutra-SCG according to TS 38.331[82],
-	MR-DC if and only if it is configured with (NG)EN-DC or NE-DC.
NOTE 1:	The above deviates from the definition in TS 37.340 [81] (and some other specifications) i.e. according to TS 37.340 [81] a UE that is not configured with an SCG is in MR-DC when one or more bearers are terminated in the secondary node (i.e. using NR PDCP).
NOTE 2:	MR-DC includes NR-DC, but that option is not relevant for this specification.
The UE configured with NE-DC only executes a subclause of clause 5 from this specification when the concerned subclause:
-	is referrenced from a subclause, either in this specification or in TS 38.331 [82], that is executed by the UE; or
-	covers actions upon (re-)configuration of field(s), IE(s), UE variable(s) or timer(s) applicable for NE-DC;
When executing a subclause of clause 5 in this specification, the UE also follows the related general requirements as defined in clause 5.1.2 and other subclauses of this specification e.g. message processing delay requirements.
5.2	System information
5.2.1	Introduction
5.2.1.1	General
System information is divided into the MasterInformationBlock (MIB) and a number of SystemInformationBlocks (SIBs) and SystemInformationBlockPos (posSIBs). The MIB includes a limited number of most essential and most frequently transmitted parameters that are needed to acquire other information from the cell, and is transmitted on BCH. SIBs other than SystemInformationBlockType1 and posSIBs are carried in SystemInformation (SI) messages. The mapping of SIBs and posSIBs to SI messages is flexibly configurable by schedulingInfoList and posSchedulingInfoList, respectively, included in SystemInformationBlockType1, with restrictions that: each SIB is contained only in a single SI message and each SIB and posSIB is contained at most once in that SI message; only SIBs and posSIBs having the same scheduling requirement (periodicity) can be mapped to the same SI message; SystemInformationBlockType2 is always mapped to the SI message that corresponds to the first entry in the list of SI messages in schedulingInfoList. There may be multiple SI messages transmitted with the same periodicity. SystemInformationBlockType1 and all SI messages are transmitted on DL-SCH.
The Bandwidth reduced Low Complexity (BL) UEs and UEs in Coverage Enhancement (CE) apply Bandwidth Reduced (BR) version of the SIB, posSIB or SI messages. A UE considers itself in enhanced coverage as specified in TS 36.304 [4]. In this and subsequent clauses, anything applicable for a particular SIB, posSIB or SI message equally applies to the corresponding BR version unless explicitly stated otherwise.
For NB-IoT, a reduced set of system information block with similar functionality but different content is defined; the UE applies the NB-IoT (NB) version of the MIB and the SIBs. These are denoted MasterInformationBlock-NB, MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB and SystemInformationBlockTypeX-NB in this specification. All other system information blocks (without NB suffix) are not applicable to NB-IoT; this is not further stated in the corresponding text.
NOTE 1:	The physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take. When DCI format 1C is used the maximum allowed by the physical layer is 1736 bits (217 bytes) while for format 1A the limit is 2216 bits (277 bytes), see TS 36.212 [22] and TS 36.213 [23]. For BL UEs and UEs in CE, the maximum SIB and SI message size is 936 bits, see TS 36.213 [23]. For NB-IoT, the maximum SIB and SI message size is 680 bits, see TS 36.213 [23].
In addition to broadcasting, E-UTRAN may provide SystemInformationBlockType1 and/or SystemInformationBlockType2, including the same parameter values, via dedicated signalling i.e., within an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
The UE applies the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedures for the PCell, except when being a BL UE or a UE in CE or a NB-IoT UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode while T311 is not running. For an SCell, E-UTRAN provides, via dedicated signalling, all system information relevant for operation in RRC_CONNECTED when adding the SCell. However, a UE that is configured with DC shall aquire the MasterInformationBlock of the PSCell but use it only to determine the SFN timing of the SCG, which may be different from the MCG. Upon change of the relevant system information of a configured SCell, E-UTRAN releases and subsequently adds the concerned SCell, which may be done with a single RRCConnectionReconfiguration message. If the UE is receiving or interested to receive an MBMS service in a cell, the UE shall apply the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedure to acquire parameters relevant for MBMS operation and apply the parameters acquired from system information only for MBMS operation for this cell.
NOTE 2:	E-UTRAN may configure via dedicated signalling different parameter values than the ones broadcast in the concerned SCell.
In MBMS-dedicated cell, non-MBSFN subframes are used for providing MasterInformationBlock-MBMS (MIB-MBMS) and SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS. SIBs other than SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS are carried in SystemInformation-MBMS message which is also provided on non-MBSFN subframes.
An RN configured with an RN subframe configuration does not need to apply the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedures. Upon change of any system information relevant to an RN, E-UTRAN provides the system information blocks containing the relevant system information to an RN configured with an RN subframe configuration via dedicated signalling using the RNReconfiguration message. For RNs configured with an RN subframe configuration, the system information contained in this dedicated signalling replaces any corresponding stored system information and takes precedence over any corresponding system information acquired through the system information acquisition procedure. The dedicated system information remains valid until overridden.
NOTE 3:	E-UTRAN may configure an RN, via dedicated signalling, with different parameter values than the ones broadcast in the concerned cell.
5.2.1.2	Scheduling
The MIB uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 40 ms and repetitions made within 40 ms. The first transmission of the MIB is scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 4 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames. For TDD/FDD system with a bandwidth larger than 1.4 MHz that supports BL UEs or UEs in CE, MIB transmission may additionally be repeated in subframe#0 of the same radio frame, and in subframe#9 of the previous radio frame for FDD and subframe #5 of the same radio frame for TDD.
NOTE:	The UE may assume the scheduling of MIB repetitions does not change. E-UTRAN may indicate in MobilityControlInfo whether optional MIB repetitions are enabled or not.
The MIB-MBMS uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 160 ms and repetitions made within 160 ms. The first transmission of the MIB-MBMS is scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 16 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames for which the SFN mod 4 = 0.
The SystemInformationBlockType1 uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 80 ms and repetitions made within 80 ms. The first transmission of SystemInformationBlockType1 is scheduled in subframe #5 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 8 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #5 of all other radio frames for which SFN mod 2 = 0.
For BL UEs or UEs in CE, MIB is applied which may be provided with additional repetitions, while for SIB1 and further SI messages, separate messages are used which are scheduled independently and with content that may differ. The separate instance of SIB1 is named as SystemInformationBlockType1-BR. The SystemInformationBlockType1-BR uses a schedule with a periodicity of 80ms. TBS for SystemInformationBlockType1-BR and the repetitions made within 80ms are indicated via schedulingInfoSIB1-BR in MIB or optionally in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the MobilityControlInfo.
The SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS uses fixed schedule with a periodicity of 160 ms. The first transmission of SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS is scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 16 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames for which SFN mod 8 = 0. Additionally, the SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS and other system informations blocks may be scheduled in additional non-MBSFN subframes indicated in MasterInformationBlock-MBMS.
The SI messages are transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows) using dynamic scheduling. Each SI message is associated with a SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI is transmitted. The length of the SI-window is common for all SI messages, and is configurable. Within the SI-window, the corresponding SI message can be transmitted a number of times in any subframe other than MBSFN subframes, uplink subframes in TDD, and subframe #5 of radio frames for which SFN mod 2 = 0. The UE acquires the detailed time-domain scheduling (and other information, e.g. frequency-domain scheduling, used transport format) from decoding SI-RNTI on PDCCH (see TS 36.321 [6]). For a BL UE or a UE in CE, the detailed time/frequency domain scheduling information for the SI messages is provided in SystemInformationBlockType1-BR.
For UEs other than BL UE or UEs in CE SI-RNTI is used to address SystemInformationBlockType1 as well as all SI messages. On MBMS-dedicated cell and on FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell, SI-RNTI with value in accordance with TS 36.321 [6] is used to address all SI messages whereas SI-RNTI with value in accordance with TS 36.321 [6] is used to address SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS.
SystemInformationBlockType1 configures the SI-window length and the transmission periodicity for the SI messages.
5.2.1.2a	Scheduling for NB-IoT
The MasterInformationBlock-NB (MIB-NB) uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 640 ms and repetitions made within 640 ms. The first transmission of the MIB-NB is scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 64 = 0 and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames. The transmissions are arranged in 8 independently decodable blocks of 80 ms duration.
The MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB (MIB-TDD-NB) uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 640 ms and repetitions made within 640 ms. The first transmission of the MIB-TDD-NB is scheduled in subframe #9 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 64 = 0 and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #9 of all other radio frames. The transmissions are arranged in 8 independently decodable blocks of 80 ms duration.
The SystemInformationBlockType1-NB (SIB1-NB) uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 2560 ms.
For FDD, SIB1-NB transmission occurs in subframe #4 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames. The starting frame for the first transmission of the SIB1-NB is derived from the cell PCID and the number of repetitions within the 2560 ms period and repetitions are made, equally spaced, within the 2560 ms period (see TS 36.213 [23]). TBS for SystemInformationBlockType1-NB and the repetitions made within the 2560 ms are indicated by schedulingInfoSIB1 field in the MIB-NB. If additionalTransmissionSIB1 is set to TRUE in the MIB-NB, additional SIB1-NB transmission occurs in subframe #3 of the same radio frames where SIB1-NB transmission occurs with the same number of repetitions.
For TDD, SIB1-NB transmission on the anchor carrier occurs in either subframe #0 or subframe #4 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames and SIB1-NB transmission on a non-anchor carrier occurs in subframe #0 and next in subframe #5 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames. The starting frame for the first transmission of the SIB1-NB is derived from the cell PCID and the number of repetitions within the 2560 ms period and repetitions are made, equally spaced, within the 2560 ms period (see TS 36.213 [23]). TBS for SystemInformationBlockType1-NB, the repetitions made within the 2560 ms, and the subframe index (#0 or #4) are indicated by schedulingInfoSIB1 field in the MIB-TDD-NB.
The SI messages are transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows) using scheduling information provided in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB. Each SI message is associated with a SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI is transmitted. The length of the SI-window is common for all SI messages, and is configurable.
Within the SI-window, the corresponding SI message can be transmitted a number of times over 2 or 8 consecutive NB-IoT downlink subframes depending on TBS.The UE acquires the detailed time/frequency domain scheduling information and other information, e.g. used transport format for the SI messages from schedulingInfoList field in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB. The UE is not required to accumulate several SI messages in parallel but may need to accumulate a SI message across multiple SI windows, depending on coverage condition.
SystemInformationBlockType1-NB configures the SI-window length and the transmission periodicity for all SI messages.
5.2.1.3	System information validity and notification of changes
Change of system information (other than for ETWS, CMAS, EAB, and UAC parameters and other than for AB parameters for NB-IoT) only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. System information may be transmitted a number of times with the same content within a modification period, as defined by its scheduling. The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by system information. If H-SFN is provided in SystemInformationBlockType1-BR, modification period boundaries for BL UEs and UEs in CE are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m=0. For NB-IoT, H-SFN is always provided and the modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m=0.
To enable system information update notification for RRC_IDLE UEs configured to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period, an eDRX acquisition period is defined. The boundaries of the eDRX acquisition period are determined by H-SFN values for which H-SFN mod 256 =0. For NB-IoT, the boundaries of the eDRX acquisition period are determined by H-SFN values for which H-SFN mod 1024 =0.
NOTE 1:	If the UE in RRC_IDLE is configured to use extended DRX cycle, e.g., in the order of several minutes or longer, in case the eNB is reset the UE SFN may not be synchronized to the new eNB SFN. The UE is expected to recover, e.g., acquire MIB within a reasonable time, to avoid repeated paging failures.
NOTE 1a:	For the UE in RRC_INACTIVE, the idle mode extended DRX cycle, if configured, is used to compare with the modification period.
When the network changes (some of the) system information, it first notifies the UEs about this change, i.e. this may be done throughout a modification period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated system information. During a modification period where ETWS or CMAS transmission is started or stopped, the SI messages carrying the SIBs scheduled in schedulingInfoListExt and/or SI messages carrying the posSIBs scheduled in posSchedulingInfoList may change, so the UE might not be able to successfully receive those SIBs and/or posSIBs in the remainder of the current modification period and next modification period according to the scheduling information received prior to the change. These general principles are illustrated in figure 5.2.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate different system information. Upon receiving a change notification, the UE not configured to use a DRX cycle that is longer than the modification period acquires the new system information immediately from the start of the next modification period. Upon receiving a change notification applicable to eDRX, a UE in RRC_IDLE configured to use a DRX cycle that is longer than the modification period acquires the updated system information immediately from the start of the next eDRX acquisition period. The UE applies the previously acquired system information until the UE acquires the new system information. The possible boundaries of modification for SystemInformationBlockType1-BR are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod 512 = 0 except for notification of ETWS/CMAS for which the eNB may change SystemInformationBlockType1-BR content at any time. For NB-IoT, the possible boundaries of modification for SystemInformationBlockType1-NB are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod 4096 = 0.


Figure 5.2.1.3-1: Change of system Information
The Paging message is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about a system information change. If the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED or is not configured to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period in RRC_IDLE, and receives a Paging message including the systemInfoModification, it knows that the system information will change at the next modification period boundary. A UE in RRC_IDLE that is configured to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period, and receives in an eDRX acquisition period at least one Paging message including the systemInfoModification-eDRX, shall acquire the updated system information at the next eDRX acquisition period boundary. Although the UE may be informed about changes in system information, no further details are provided e.g. regarding which system information will change, except if systemInfoValueTagSI is received by BL UEs or UEs in CE.
In RRC_CONNECTED, BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs are not required to acquire system information except when T311 is running, or upon handover where the UE is only required to acquire the MasterInformationBlock in the target PCell, or for UEs in CE to receive ETWS/CMAS information. In RRC_IDLE, E-UTRAN may notify BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs about SI update, and except for NB-IoT, ETWS and CMAS notification, EAB modification and UAC modification, using Direct Indication information, as specified in 6.6 (or 6.7.5 in NB-IoT) and TS 36.212 [22].
NOTE 2:	Upon system information change essential for BL UEs, UEs in CE, or NB-IoT UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, E-UTRAN may initiate connection release.
SystemInformationBlockType1 (or MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB in NB-IoT) includes a value tag systemInfoValueTag, that indicates if a change has occurred in the SI messages. UEs may use systemInfoValueTag, e.g. upon return from out of coverage, to verify if the previously stored SI messages are still valid. MasterInformationBlock and RSS (if transmitted, see TS 36.211 [21]) may indicate using systemInfoUnchanged-BR that a change has not occurred in the SIB1-BR and SI messages of the current cell at least over the SI validity time, and the BL UEs or UEs in CE may use the systemInfoUnchanged-BR, e.g. upon return from out of coverage, to verify if the previously stored SIB1-BR and SI messages are still valid. Additionally, for other than BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs, the UE considers stored system information to be invalid after 3 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid, unless specified otherwise. BL UE or UE in CE considers stored system information to be invalid after 24 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid, unless the UE is configured by parameter si-ValidityTime to consider stored system information to be invalid 3 hours after validity confirmation. NB-IoT UE considers stored system information to be invalid after 24 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid. If a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE in RRC_CONNECTED state considers the stored system information invalid, the UE shall continue using the stored system information while in RRC_CONNECTED state in the serving cell.
For BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs, the change of specific SI message can additionally be indicated by a SI message specific value tag systemInfoValueTagSI. If systemInfoValueTag included in the SystemInformationBlockType1-BR (or MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB in NB-IoT) is different from the one of the stored system information and if systemInfoValueTagSI is included in the SystemInformationBlockType1-BR (or SystemInformationBlockType1-NB in NB-IoT) for a specific SI message and is different from the stored one, the UE shall consider this specific SI message to be invalid. If only systemInfoValueTag is included and is different from the stored one, the BL UE or UE in CE should consider any stored system information except SystemInformationBlockType10, SystemInformationBlockType11, SystemInformationBlockType12, SystemInformationBlockType14 and SystemInformationBlockType25 to be invalid; the NB-IoT UE should consider any stored system information except SystemInformationBlockType14-NB to be invalid.
On MBMS-dedicated cell and on FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell, the change of system information and ETWS/CMAS notification is indicated by using Direct Indication FeMBMS defined in 6.6a. The modification periodicity follows MCCH modification periodicity as defined in 5.8.1.3.
E-UTRAN may not update systemInfoValueTag upon change of some system information e.g. ETWS information, CMAS information, RLOS indication (i.e., rlos-Enabled), regularly changing parameters like time information (SystemInformationBlockType8, SystemInformationBlockType16, hyperSFN-MSB in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB), EAB and AB parameters, UAC parameters, or positioning system information blocks. Similarly, E-UTRAN may not include the systemInfoModification within the Paging message upon change of some system information.
The UE that is not configured to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period verifies that stored system information remains valid by either checking systemInfoValueTag in SystemInformationBlockType1 (or MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB in NB-IoT) after the modification period boundary, or attempting to find the systemInfoModification indication at least modificationPeriodCoeff times during the modification period in case no paging is received, in every modification period. If no paging message is received by the UE during a modification period, the UE may assume that no change of system information will occur at the next modification period boundary. If UE in RRC_CONNECTED, during a modification period, receives one paging message, it may deduce from the presence/ absence of systemInfoModification whether a change of system information other than ETWS information, CMAS information, EAB and UAC parameters will occur in the next modification period or not.
When the RRC_IDLE UE is configured with a DRX cycle that is longer than the modification period, and at least one modification period boundary has passed since the UE last verified validity of stored system information, the UE verifies that stored system information remains valid by checking the systemInfoValueTag before establishing or resuming an RRC connection.
ETWS and/or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, other than BL UEs and UEs in CE, shall attempt to read paging at least once every defaultPagingCycle to check whether ETWS and/or CMAS notification is present or not.
5.2.1.4	Indication of ETWS notification
ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification can occur at any point in time. The Paging message is used to inform ETWS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs not in CE in RRC_CONNECTED about presence of an ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification. For UEs in CE supporting reception of ETWS indication in RRC_CONNECTED mode, control channels associated with the shared data channel are used to inform the UE about the presence of an ETWS primary notification and/or ETWS secondary notification. If the UE receives a Paging message or control channels associated with the shared data channel including the etws-Indication, it shall start receiving the ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification according to schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1. If the UE receives Paging message or control channels associated with the shared data channel including the etws-Indication while it is acquiring ETWS notification(s), the UE shall continue acquiring ETWS notification(s) based on the previously acquired schedulingInfoList until it re-acquires schedulingInfoList in SystemInformationBlockType1.
NOTE:	The UE is not required to periodically check schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1, but Paging message including the etws-Indication triggers the UE to re-acquire schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1 for scheduling changes for SystemInformationBlockType10 and SystemInformationBlockType11. The UE may or may not receive a Paging message including the etws-Indication and/or systemInfoModification when ETWS is no longer scheduled.
ETWS primary notification is contained in SystemInformationBlockType10 and ETWS secondary notification is contained in SystemInformationBlockType11. Segmentation can be applied for the delivery of a secondary notification. The segmentation is fixed for transmission of a given secondary notification within a cell (i.e. the same segment size for a given segment with the same messageIdentifier, serialNumber and warningMessageSegmentNumber). An ETWS secondary notification corresponds to a single CB data IE as defined according to TS 23.041 [37].
5.2.1.5	Indication of CMAS notification
CMAS notification can occur at any point in time. The Paging message is used to inform CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs not in CE in RRC_CONNECTED about presence of one or more CMAS notifications. For UEs in CE supporting reception of CMAS indication in RRC_CONNECTED mode, control channels associated with the shared data channel are used to inform the UE about the presence of one or more CMAS notifications. If the UE receives a Paging message including the cmas-Indication, it shall start receiving the CMAS notifications according to schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1. If the UE receives Paging message or control channels associated with the shared data channel including the cmas-Indication while it is acquiring CMAS notification(s), the UE shall continue acquiring CMAS notification(s) based on the previously acquired schedulingInfoList until it re-acquires schedulingInfoList in SystemInformationBlockType1.
NOTE:	The UE is not required to periodically check schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1, but Paging message including the cmas-Indication triggers the UE to re-acquire schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1 for scheduling changes for SystemInformationBlockType12. The UE may or may not receive a Paging message including the cmas-Indication and/or systemInfoModification when SystemInformationBlockType12 is no longer scheduled.
CMAS notification is contained in SystemInformationBlockType12. A CMAS notification corresponds to a single CB data IE as defined according to TS 23.041 [37]. A CMAS notification may optionally have associated warning area coordinates. Segmentation can be applied for the delivery of a CMAS notification and, if present, the associated warning area coordinates. The segmentation is fixed for transmission of a given CMAS notification and, if present, any associated warning area coordinates within a cell (i.e. the same segment size for a given segment with the same messageIdentifier, serialNumber and warningMessageSegmentNumber). E-UTRAN does not interleave transmissions of CMAS notifications, i.e. all segments of a given CMAS notification transmission are transmitted prior to those of another CMAS notification.
5.2.1.6	Notification of EAB parameters change
Change of EAB parameters can occur at any point in time. The EAB parameters are contained in SystemInformationBlockType14. The Paging message is used to inform EAB capable UEs in RRC_IDLE about a change of EAB parameters or that SystemInformationBlockType14 is no longer scheduled. If the UE receives a Paging message including the eab-ParamModification, it shall acquire SystemInformationBlockType14 according to schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1. If the UE receives a Paging message including the eab-ParamModification while it is acquiring SystemInformationBlockType14, the UE shall continue acquiring SystemInformationBlockType14 based on the previously acquired schedulingInfoList until it re-acquires schedulingInfoList in SystemInformationBlockType1.
NOTE:	The EAB capable UE is not expected to periodically check schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1.
5.2.1.7	Access Barring parameters change in NB-IoT
Change of Access Barring (AB) parameters can occur at any point in time. The AB parameters are contained in SystemInformationBlockType14-NB. Update of the AB parameters does not impact the systemInfoValueTag in the MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB or the systemInfoValueTagSI in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB.
If SystemInformationBlockType14-NB is scheduled, a NB-IoT UE connected to EPC is required to acquire MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB before initiating RRC connection establishment / resume for all access causes except mobile terminating calls to check ab-Enabled indication. If access barring is enabled the UE shall not initiate the RRC connection establishment / resume for all access causes except mobile terminating calls until the UE has acquired the SystemInformationBlockType14-NB.
If SystemInformationBlockType14-NB is scheduled, a NB-IoT UE connected to 5GC is required to acquire MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB before initiating RRC connection establishment / resume / re-establishment to check ab-Enabled-5GC indication. If access barring is enabled the UE shall not initiate the RRC connection establishment / resume / re-establishment until the UE has acquired the SystemInformationBlockType14-NB.
5.2.1.8	Notification of UAC parameters change
Change of UAC parameters can occur at any point in time. The UAC parameters are contained in SystemInformationBlockType25. The Paging message is used to inform BL UEs or UEs in CE in RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE connected to 5GC about a change of UAC parameters or that SystemInformationBlockType25 is no longer scheduled. If the UE receives a Paging message including the uac-ParamModification, it shall acquire SystemInformationBlockType25 according to schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1. If the UE receives a Paging message including the uac-ParamModification while it is acquiring SystemInformationBlockType25, the UE shall continue acquiring SystemInformationBlockType25 based on the previously acquired schedulingInfoList until it re-acquires schedulingInfoList in SystemInformationBlockType1.
NOTE:	The BL UE or UE in CE is not expected to periodically check schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1.
5.2.2	System information acquisition
5.2.2.1	General

Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition, normal
The UE applies the system information acquisition procedure to acquire the AS- and NAS- and positioning-system information that is broadcasted by the E-UTRAN. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED.
For BL UE, UE in CE and NB-IoT UE, specific conditions apply, as specified below.
5.2.2.2	Initiation
The UE shall apply the system information acquisition procedure upon selecting (e.g. upon power on) and upon re-selecting a cell, after handover completion, after entering E-UTRA from another RAT, upon return from out of coverage, upon receiving a notification that the system information has changed, upon receiving an indication about the presence of an ETWS notification, upon receiving an indication about the presence of a CMAS notification, upon receiving a notification that the EAB parameters have changed, upon receiving a request from CDMA2000 upper layers, upon receiving a request from positioning upper layers, upon receiving a notification that the UAC parameters have changed and upon exceeding the maximum validity duration. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the system information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored system information, i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for system information and the UE discontinues using a field if it is absent in system information unless explicitly specified otherwise.
In RRC_CONNECTED, BL UEs and UEs in CE are required to acquire system information when T311 is running or upon handover where the UE is only required to acquire the MasterInformationBlock in the target PCell.
NOTE:	Upon handover, E-UTRAN provides system information required by the UE in RRC_CONNECTED except MIB with RRC signalling, i.e. systemInformationBlockType1Dedicated and mobilityControlInfo.

5.3	Connection control
5.3.1	Introduction
5.3.1.1	RRC connection control
RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. Except for EDT and transmission using PUR, E-UTRAN completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment of the S1 connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from the EPC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the E-UTRAN may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting, but the UE only sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful security activation. However, the UE only accepts a handover message when security has been activated.
NOTE 1:	In case the serving frequency broadcasts multiple overlapping bands, E-UTRAN can only configure measurements after having obtained the UE capabilities, as the measurement configuration needs to be set according to the band selected by the UE.
Upon receiving the UE context from the EPC, E-UTRAN activates security (both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial security activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate security (command and successful response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to activate security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to establish SRB2 and DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered.
After having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN initiates the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. E-UTRAN may do this prior to receiving the confirmation of the initial security activation from the UE. In any case, E-UTRAN will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for the RRC connection reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2 and DRBs. E-UTRAN should release the RRC connection if the initial security activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails (i.e. security activation and DRB establishment are triggered by a joint S1-procedure, which does not support partial success).
For SRB2 and DRBs, security is always activated from the start, i.e. the E-UTRAN does not establish these bearers prior to activating security.
For some radio configuration fields, a critical extension has been defined. A switch from the original version of the field to the critically extended version is allowed using any connection reconfiguration. The UE reverts to the original version of some critically extended fields upon handover and re-establishment as specified elsewhere in this specification. Otherwise, switching a field from the critically extended version to the original version is only possible using the handover or re-establishment procedure with the full configuration option. This also applies for fields that are critically extended within a release (i.e. original and extended version defined in same release).
After having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN may configure a UE that supports CA, with one or more SCells in addition to the PCell that was initially configured during connection establishment. The PCell is used to provide the security inputs and upper layer system information (i.e. the NAS mobility information e.g. TAI). SCells are used to provide additional downlink and optionally uplink radio resources. When not configured with any kind of DC, all SCells the UE is configured with, if any, are part of the MCG.
When configured with DC, some of the SCells are part of a SCG. In this case, user data carried by a DRB may either be transferred via MCG (i.e. MCG-DRB), via SCG (SCG-DRB) or via both MCG and SCG in DL while E-UTRAN configures the CG used in UL (split DRB). An RRC connection reconfiguration message may be used to change the DRB type from MCG-DRB to SCG-DRB or to split DRB, as well as from SCG-DRB or split DRB to MCG-DRB.
DC employs SCG change, which is a synchronous SCG reconfiguration procedure (i.e. involving RA to the PSCell) including reset/ re-establishment of layer 2 and, if SCG DRBs are configured, refresh of security. The procedure is used in a number of different scenarios e.g. SCG establishment, PSCell change, Key refresh, change of DRB type. The UE performs the SCG change related actions upon receiving an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including mobilityControlInfoSCG, see 5.3.10.10.
In case of MR-DC, the cells of one CG use another RAT, namely NR. The configuration of an NR CG is specified in TS 38.331 [82]. When configured with MR-DC, user data carried by a DRB may either be transferred via MCG, via NR SCG or via both MCG and NR SCG. Also RRC signalling carried by a SRB may either be transferred via MCG or via both MCG and NR SCG. When DRBs and SRBs are configured with transmission via both MCG and SCG, duplication may be used in both DL and UL.
When connected to EPC, change to NR PDCP or vice versa can be done for both SRBs and DRBs as follows. For DRBs, it can be performed using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message either with or without the mobilityControlInfo (handover) by release and addition of the concerned RB. For SRBs, it can be performed using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message with the mobilityControlInfo (handover) by release and addition of the concerned PDCP entity. For SRBs and DRBs, it can also be performed using the full configuration option. The same RRCConnectionReconfiguration message may be used to make changes regarding the CG(s) used for transmission. For SRB1, change from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP type may, before initial security activation, also be performed using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message not including the mobilityControlInfo.
In case of (NG)EN-DC, there are three types of NR SCG reconfigurations:
-	Reconfiguration with sync and key change i.e. a procedure involving RA to the PSCell, including NR MAC reset, re-establishment of NR RLC and NR PDCP and refresh of NR SCG security; and
-	Reconfiguration with sync but without key change i.e. a procedure involving RA to the PSCell, including NR MAC reset and NR RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery (for AM DRB); and
-	Regular NR SCG reconfiguration neither involving refresh of NR SCG security, nor RA to the PSCell, NR MAC reset or NR RLC re-establishment;
The network is only required to use the NR SCG reconfiguration with sync and key change in case the NR SCG security key changes (i.e. handover, change of SNs, S-KgNB refresh). Further details are specified in NR RRC TS 38.331 [82].
NOTE 2:	In case of MR-DC, E-UTRA RRC configuration parameters should only affect E-UTRA operation. E.g., s-Measure only affects measurements configured by parameters defined in this specification. Should an E-UTRA RRC configuration change require a change of NR RRC configuration, the network should indicate such NR change by NR RRC signalling. E.g. a specific indication is used to trigger RLC re-establishment upon reconfigurations changing the CG(s) used for transmission (in DL or UL) that otherwise would only involve NR RRC signalling.
In this release of the specification, change between DC and MR-DC as well as change between DC and E-UTRA configured with SN terminated DRB without SCG are not supported (i.e. neither the direct reconfiguration nor specific measurement events). Likewise, the direct transition between (NG)EN-DC and NR DC or NE-DC is not supported in this release of the specification.
The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by E-UTRAN. The procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an E-UTRA frequency or an inter-RAT carrier frequency. Only in exceptional cases, as specified within this specification, TS 36.300 [9], TS 36.304 [4] or TS 24.301 [35], may the UE abort the RRC connection, i.e. move to RRC_IDLE without notifying E-UTRAN.
The suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC. When the RRC connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE AS context and the resumeIdentity (EPC) or I-RNTI (5GC), and transitions to RRC_IDLE state. The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and ciphered. Suspension can only be performed when at least 1 DRB is successfully established.
The resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when the UE has a stored UE AS context, RRC connection resume is permitted by E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC and the UE needs to transit from RRC_IDLE state to RRC_CONNECTED state. When the RRC connection is resumed, RRC configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE AS context and any RRC configuration received from E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s). The request to resume the RRC connection includes the resumeIdentity (EPC) or I-RNTI (5GC). The request is not ciphered, but protected with a message authentication code.
In response to a request to resume the RRC connection, E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC may resume the suspended RRC connection, reject the request to resume and instruct the UE to either keep or discard the stored context, or setup a new RRC connection.
In case of CP-EDT or CP transmission using PUR, the data are appended in the RRCEarlyDataRequest and RRCEarlyDataComplete messages, if available, and sent over SRB0. In case of UP-EDT or UP transmission using PUR, security is re-activated prior to transmission of RRC message using the nextHopChainingCount provided in the RRCConnectionRelease message with suspend indication during the preceding suspend procedure and the radio bearers are re-established. The uplink data are transmitted ciphered on DTCH multiplexed with the RRCConnectionResumeRequest message on CCCH. In the downlink, the data, if available, are transmitted on DTCH multiplexed with the RRCConnectionRelease message on DCCH. In response to a request for EDT or transmission using PUR, E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC may also choose to establish or resume the RRC connection.
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED enters RRC_INACTIVE when the network indicates RRC connection suspension in RRCConnectionRelease message. When entering RRC_INACTIVE, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS context and any RRC configuration received from the network.
The resumption of an RRC connection from RRC_INACTIVE is initiated by upper layers when the UE needs to transit from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED state or by RRC layer for, e.g. RNAU or reception of RAN paging. When the RRC connection is resumed, network configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE Inactive AS context and any RRC configuration received from the network. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s).
In response to a request to resume the RRC connection from RRC_INACTIVE, the network may resume the suspended RRC connection and UE enters to RRC_CONNECTED, or reject the request to resume using RRC message without security protection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE with wait time, or directly re-suspend the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE, or directly release the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_IDLE, or instruct the UE to initiate NAS level recovery.
NOTE 3:	In case the configurations for V2X sidelink communication are acquired from NR, the configurations for V2X sidelink communication in SystemInformationBlockType21, SystemInformationBlockType26, SL-V2X-ConfigDedicated within RRCConnectionReconfiguration used in this subclause can be provided by SIB13, SIB14, sl-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA within RRCReconfiguration as specified in TS 38.331 [82], respectively.
5.3.1.2	Security
AS security comprises of the integrity protection of RRC signalling (SRBs) as well as the ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).
RRC handles the configuration of the security parameters which are part of the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm and two parameters, namely the keyChangeIndicator and the nextHopChainingCount, which are used by the UE to determine the AS security keys upon handover, connection re-establishment, connection resume, UP-EDT and/ or UP transmission using PUR.
The integrity protection algorithm is common for signalling radio bearers SRB1, SRB2 and SRB4. When configured with MCG only, the ciphering algorithm is common for all radio bearers (i.e. SRB1, SRB2, SRB4 and DRBs). Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.
RRC integrity and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one message/ procedure. RRC integrity and ciphering are never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a 'NULL' ciphering algorithm (eea0).
The 'NULL' integrity protection algorithm (eia0) is used only for the UE in limited service mode, as specified in TS 33.401 [32]. In case the 'NULL' integrity protection algorithm is used, 'NULL' ciphering algorithm is also used.
NOTE 1:	Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity check has failed and indicate the integrity verification check failure to RRC.
The AS applies three different security keys: one for the integrity protection of RRC signalling (KRRCint), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling (KRRCenc) and one for the ciphering of user data (KUPenc). All three AS keys are derived from the KeNB key. The KeNB is based on the KASME key for E-UTRA/EPC, or KAMF for E-UTRA/5GC, which is handled by upper layers.
Upon connection establishment new AS keys are derived. No AS-parameters are exchanged to serve as inputs for the derivation of the new AS keys at connection establishment.
The integrity and ciphering of the RRC message used to perform handover is based on the security configuration used prior to the handover and is performed by the source eNB.
The integrity and ciphering algorithms can only be changed upon handover. The four AS keys (KeNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc and KUPenc) change upon every handover, connection re-establishment, connection resume, UP-EDT and UP transmission using PUR. The keyChangeIndicator is used upon handover and indicates whether the UE should use the keys associated with the KASME key for E-UTRA/EPC, or KAMF for E-UTRA/5GC, taken into use with the latest successful NAS SMC procedure. The nextHopChainingCount parameter is used upon handover, connection re-establishment, connection resume, UP-EDT and UP transmission using PUR by the UE when deriving the new KeNB that is used to generate KRRCint, KRRCenc and KUPenc (see TS 33.401 [32]). An intra cell handover procedure may be used to change the keys in RRC_CONNECTED.
For each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 36.323 [8] for E-UTRA/EPC, and TS 38.323 [83] for E-UTRA/5GC) is maintained for each direction. For each DRB, the COUNT is used as input for ciphering. For each SRB, the COUNT is used as input for both ciphering and integrity protection. It is not allowed to use the same COUNT value more than once for a given security key. At connection resume the COUNT is reset. As specified in TS 33.401 subclause 7.2.9.1 [32], the eNB is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the same RB identity and with the same KeNB, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs, and multiple termination point changes for RLC-UM bearers, multiple termination point changes for RLC-AM bearer with SN terminated PDCP re-establishment (COUNT reset) due to SN only full configuration whilst the key stream inputs (i.e. bearer ID, security key) at MN have not been updated. In order to avoid such re-use, the eNB may e.g. use different RB identities for successive RB establishments, trigger an intra cell handover or by triggering a transition from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE and then back to RRC_CONNECTED.
In order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8] for E-UTRA/EPC, and TS 38.323 [83] for E-UTRA/5GC). In addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (TX_HFN and RX_HFN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8] for E-UTRA/EPC, and HFN as specified in TS 38.323 [83] for E-UTRA/5GC). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE and the eNB.
For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is the value of the corresponding srb-Identity with the MSBs padded with zeroes.
With E-UTRA/5GC for a UE not capable of NGEN-DC, the same ciphering algorithm signalled at SMC or handover is used for all radio bearers. Likewise, the same integrity algorithm signalled at SMC or handover is used for all SRBs.
In case of DC, a separate KeNB is used for SCG-DRBs (S-KeNB). This key is derived from the key used for the MCG (KeNB) and an SCG counter that is used to ensure freshness. To refresh the S-KeNB e.g. when the COUNT will wrap around, E-UTRAN employs an SCG change, i.e. an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including mobilityControlInfoSCG. When performing handover, while at least one SCG-DRB remains configured, both KeNB and S-KeNB are refreshed. In such case E-UTRAN performs handover with SCG change i.e. an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including both mobilityControlInfo and mobilityControlInfoSCG. The ciphering algorithm is common for all radio bearers within a CG but may be different between MCG and SCG. The ciphering algorithm for SCG DRBs can only be changed upon SCG change.
In case of (NG)EN-DC or of SN terminated RB without SCG, the network indicates whether the UE shall use either KeNB or S-KgNB for a particular DRB. In case of NE-DC, the network indicates whether the UE shall use either KgNB or S-KeNB for a particular DRB. S-KgNB/S-KeNB is derived from KeNB/KgNB as defined in TS 33.501 [86], uses a different counter (sk-Counter) and is used only for DRBs using NR PDCP. Whenever there is a need to refresh S-KgNB/S-KeNB, e.g. upon change of MN or SN, the NR SCG reconfiguration with sync and key change is used for S-KgNB refresh (see 5.3.1.1) and the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including mobilityControlInfoSCG is used for S-KeNB refresh (see 5.3.10.10). E-UTRAN provides a UE configured with (NG)EN-DC with an sk-Counter even when no DRB is setup using S-KgNB i.e. to facilitate configuration of SRB3. The same ciphering algorithm as signalled by nr-RadioBearerConfig1 and nr-RadioBearerConfig2 as defined in TS 38.331 [82] is used for all radio bearers using the same key (i.e. KeNB or S-KgNB). Likewise, the same integrity algorithm as signalled by nr-RadioBearerConfig1 and nr-RadioBearerConfig2 as defined in TS 38.331 [82] is used for all SRBs using the same key. Although NR RRC uses different values for the security algorithms than E-UTRA, the actual algorithms are the same in case of (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC in this version of the specification. Hence, for such algorithms, the security capabilities supported by a UE are consistent across these RATs. For MR-DC, integrity protection is not enabled for DRBs terminated on eNB or when the master node is an ng-eNB.
NOTE 2:	The network ensures that different values are used for the SCG counter and for the sk-Counter when deriving S-KgNB and/or S-KeNB from the same master key.
5.3.1.2a	RN security
For RNs, AS security follows the procedures in 5.3.1.2. Furthermore, E-UTRAN may configure per DRB whether or not integrity protection is used. The use of integrity protection may be configured only upon DRB establishment and reconfigured only upon handover or upon the first reconfiguration following RRC connection re-establishment.
To provide integrity protection on DRBs between the RN and the E-UTRAN, the KUPint key is derived from the KeNB key as described in TS 33.401 [32]. The same integrity protection algorithm used for SRBs also applies to the DRBs. The KUPint changes at every handover and RRC connection re-establishment and is based on an updated KeNB which is derived by taking into account the nextHopChainingCount. The COUNT value maintained for DRB ciphering is also used for integrity protection, if the integrity protection is configured for the DRB.
5.3.1.3	Connected mode mobility
In RRC_CONNECTED, the network controls UE mobility, i.e. the network decides when the UE shall connect to which E-UTRA cell(s), or inter-RAT cell. For network controlled mobility in RRC_CONNECTED, the PCell can be changed using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the mobilityControlInfo (handover), whereas the SCell(s) can be changed using the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message either with or without the mobilityControlInfo.
In DC, an SCG can be established, reconfigured or released by using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message with or without the mobilityControlInfo. In case Random Access to the PSCell or initial PUSCH transmission to the PSCell if rach-SkipSCG is configured is required upon SCG reconfiguration, E-UTRAN employs the SCG change procedure (i.e. an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the mobilityControlInfoSCG). The PSCell can only be changed using the SCG change procedure and by release and addition of the PSCell.
In (NG)EN-DC, an NR SCG can be established or reconfigured by using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message containing nr-secondaryCellGroupConfig and nr-RadioBearerConfig. The contents of nr-secondaryCellGroupConfig and nr-RadioBearerConfig, of other (NG)EN-DC fields as well as the associated procedures are specified in TS 38.331 [82]. In (NG)EN-DC, the PSCell can only be changed using the Reconfiguration with sync procedure, with or without MR-DC release and addition.
The network triggers the handover procedure e.g. based on radio conditions, load. To facilitate this, the network may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting (possibly including the configuration of measurement gaps). The network may also initiate handover blindly, i.e. without having received measurement reports from the UE.
Before sending the handover message to the UE, the source eNB prepares one or more target cells. The source eNB selects the target PCell. The source eNB may also provide the target eNB with a list of best cells on each frequency for which measurement information is available, in order of decreasing RSRP. The source eNB may also include available measurement information for the cells provided in the list. The target eNB decides which SCells are configured for use after handover, which may include cells other than the ones indicated by the source eNB. If an SCG is configured, handover involves either SCG release or either SCG change (in case of DC) or an NR SCG reconfiguration with sync and key change (in case of EN-DC and NGEN-DC). In case the UE was configured with (EN-) DC or NGEN-DC, the target eNB indicates in the handover message whether the UE shall release the entire (NR) SCG configuration. Upon connection re-establishment, the UE releases the entire SCG configuration except for the DRB configuration, while E-UTRAN in the first reconfiguration message following the re-establishment either releases the DRB(s) or reconfigures the DRB(s) to MCG DRB(s).
The target eNB generates the message used to perform the handover, i.e. the message including the AS-configuration to be used in the target cell(s). The source eNB transparently (i.e. does not alter values/ content) forwards the handover message/ information received from the target to the UE. When appropriate, the source eNB may initiate data forwarding for (a subset of) the DRBs.
After receiving the handover message, the UE attempts to access the target PCell at the first available RACH occasion according to Random Access resource selection defined in TS 36.321 [6], i.e. the handover is asynchronous, or at the first available PUSCH occasion if rach-Skip is configured. Consequently, when allocating a dedicated preamble for the random access in the target PCell, E-UTRA shall ensure it is available from the first RACH occasion the UE may use. The first available PUSCH occasion is provided by ul-ConfigInfo, if configured, otherwise UE shall monitor the PDCCH of target eNB. Upon successful completion of the handover, the UE sends a message used to confirm the handover.
If the target eNB does not support the release of RRC protocol which the source eNB used to configure the UE, the target eNB may be unable to comprehend the UE configuration provided by the source eNB. In this case, the target eNB should use the full configuration option to reconfigure the UE for Handover and Re-establishment. Full configuration option includes an initialization of the radio configuration, which makes the procedure independent of the configuration used in the source cell(s) with the exception that the security algorithms are continued for the RRC re-establishment.
The same behavior applies in (NG)EN-DC, if upon handover the target eNB is unable to comprehend the MCG part of the UE configuration i.e. the target eNB uses the full configuration option which involves release and configuration of (most of the) MCG and NR SCG configuration. In case of (NG)EN-DC, the target SgNB may be unable to comprehend the NR SCG configuration provided by the source SgNB. In such a case, release and addition may be applied for the NR SCG part of the configuration.
NOTE 1:	When using release and addition for the NR SCG configuration during handover or SN change, E-UTRAN includes drb-ToReleaseList for the SN terminated RBs. For SN modification case, see TS 37.340 [81].
After the successful completion of handover, PDCP SDUs may be re-transmitted in the target cell(s). This only applies for DRBs using RLC-AM mode and for handovers not involving full configuration option. The further details are specified in TS 36.323 [8]. After the successful completion of handover not involving full configuration option, the SN and the HFN are reset except for the DRBs using RLC-AM mode (for which both SN and HFN continue). For reconfigurations involving the full configuration option, the PDCP entities are newly established (SN and HFN do not continue) for all DRBs irrespective of the RLC mode. The further details are specified in TS 36.323 [8].
One UE behaviour to be performed upon handover is specified, i.e. this is regardless of the handover procedures used within the network (e.g. whether the handover includes X2 or S1 signalling procedures).
The source eNB should, for some time, maintain a context to enable the UE to return in case of handover failure. After having detected handover failure, the UE attempts to resume the RRC connection either in the source PCell or in another cell using the RRC re-establishment procedure. This connection resumption succeeds only if the accessed cell is prepared, i.e. concerns a cell of the source eNB or of another eNB towards which handover preparation has been performed. The cell in which the re-establishment procedure succeeds becomes the PCell while SCells and STAGs, if configured, are released.
Normal measurement and mobility procedures are used to support handover to cells broadcasting a CSG identity. In addition, E-UTRAN may configure the UE to report that it is entering or leaving the proximity of cell(s) included in its CSG whitelist. Furthermore, E-UTRAN may request the UE to provide additional information broadcast by the handover candidate cell e.g. global cell identity, CSG identity, CSG membership status.
NOTE 2:	E-UTRAN may use the 'proximity report' to configure measurements as well as to decide whether or not to request additional information broadcast by the handover candidate cell. The additional information is used to verify whether or not the UE is authorised to access the target PCell and may also be needed to identify handover candidate cell (PCI confusion i.e. when the physical layer identity that is included in the measurement report does not uniquely identify the cell).
5.3.1.4	Connection control in NB-IoT
In NB-IoT, during the RRC connection establishment procedure, SRB1bis is established implicitly with SRB1. SRB1bis uses the logical channel identity defined in 9.1.2a, with the same configuration as SRB1 but no PDCP entity. SRB1bis is used until security is activated. The RRC messages to activate security (command and successful response) are sent over SRB1 being integrity protected and ciphering is started after completion of the procedure. In case of unsuccessful security activation, the failure message is sent over SRB1 and subsequent messages are sent over SRB1bis. Once security is activated, new RRC messages shall be transmitted using SRB1. A NB-IoT UE that only supports the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation (see TS 24.301 [35]) or the Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation (see TS 24.501 [95]) only establishes SRB1bis.
A NB-IoT UE only supports 0, 1 or 2 DRBs, depending on its capability. A NB-IoT UE that only supports the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation (see TS 24.301 [35]) or the Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation (see TS 24.501 [95]) does not need to support any DRBs and associated procedures.
Table 5.3.1.4-1 lists the procedures that are applicable for NB-IoT. All other procedures are not applicable; this is not further stated in the corresponding procedures.

The purpose of this procedure is to establish an RRC connection, to resume a suspended RRC connection, to move the UE from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_CONNECTED, to perform EDT or to perform transmission using PUR. RRC connection establishment involves SRB1 (and SRB1bis for NB-IoT) establishment. The procedure is also used to transfer the initial NAS dedicated information/ message from the UE to E-UTRAN.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
-	When establishing an RRC connection:
-	to establish SRB1 and, for NB-IoT, SRB1bis;
-	When resuming an RRC connection from a suspended RRC connection or from RRC_INACTIVE:
-	to restore the AS configuration from a stored context including resuming SRB(s) and DRB(s);
-	When performing EDT;
-	When performing transmission using PUR.

5.3.4	Initial security activation
5.3.4.1	General

Figure 5.3.4.1-1: Security mode command, successful

Figure 5.3.4.1-2: Security mode command, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to activate AS security upon RRC connection establishment.
5.3.4.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the security mode command procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED. Moreover, E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
-	when only SRB1, or for NB-IoT SRB1 and SRB1bis, is established, i.e. prior to establishment of SRB2 and/ or DRBs.
5.3.4.3	Reception of the SecurityModeCommand by the UE
The UE shall:
1>	derive the KeNB key, as specified in TS 33.401 [32] for E-UTRA/EPC, and TS 33.501 [86] for E-UTRA/5GC;
1>	derive the KRRCint key associated with the integrityProtAlgorithm indicated in the SecurityModeCommand message, as specified in TS 33.401 [32];
1>	request lower layers to verify the integrity protection of the SecurityModeCommand message, using the algorithm indicated by the integrityProtAlgorithm as included in the SecurityModeCommand message and the KRRCint key;
1>	if the SecurityModeCommand message passes the integrity protection check:
2>	derive the KRRCenc key and the KUPenc key associated with the cipheringAlgorithm indicated in the SecurityModeCommand message, as specified in TS 33.401 [32];
2>	if connected as an RN:
3>	derive the KUPint key associated with the integrityProtAlgorithm indicated in the SecurityModeCommand message, as specified in TS 33.401 [32];
2>	configure lower layers to apply integrity protection using the indicated algorithm and the KRRCint key immediately, i.e. integrity protection shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by the UE, including the SecurityModeComplete message;
2>	configure lower layers to apply ciphering using the indicated algorithm, the KRRCenc key and the KUPenc key after completing the procedure, i.e. ciphering shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by the UE, except for the SecurityModeComplete message which is sent unciphered;
2>	if connected as an RN:
3>	configure lower layers to apply integrity protection using the indicated algorithm and the KUPint key, for DRBs that are subsequently configured to apply integrity protection, if any;
2>	consider AS security to be activated;
2>	upon RRC connection establishment, if UE does not need UL gaps during continuous uplink transmission:
3>	configure lower layers to stop using UL gaps during continuous uplink transmission in FDD for SecurityModeComplete message and subsequent uplink transmission in RRC_CONNECTED except for UL transmissions as specified in TS 36.211 [21];

1>	else:
2>	continue using the configuration used prior to the reception of the SecurityModeCommand message, i.e. neither apply integrity protection nor ciphering.
2>	submit the SecurityModeFailure message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
5.3.5	RRC connection reconfiguration
5.3.5.1	General

Figure 5.3.5.1-1: RRC connection reconfiguration, successful

Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC connection reconfiguration, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to establish/ modify/ release RBs, to perform handover, to setup/ modify/ release measurements, to add/ modify/ release SCells, to add/modify/release conditional reconfigurations. As part of the procedure, NAS dedicated information may be transferred from E-UTRAN to the UE.
5.3.5.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN may initiate the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED. E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
-	the mobilityControlInfo is included only when AS-security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
-	the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during RRC connection establishment) is included only when AS security has been activated;
-	the addition of SCells is performed only when AS security has been activated;
-	the addition, release or modification of conditional reconfigurations is performed only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
The UE initiates the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure while in RRC_CONNECTED when a conditional reconfiguration (e.g. CHO) is executed i.e. upon the fulfilment of an execution condition, an associated RRCConnectionReconfiguration that is stored is applied.
NOTE:	Embedding in an NR Reconfiguration is used for the transfer of IRAT DL DCCH information as used for V2X sidelink communication related information specified by NR RRC e.g. to configure dedicated pool related information, CBR measurements, provision of grant assistance.

-	the MCG C-RNTI,
-	the MCG security configuration,
-	the configurations (SDAP if configured, PDCP, RLC and logical channel) for the RBs;
-	the logged measurement configuration;
NOTE 1:	Radio configuration is not just the resource configuration but includes other configurations like MeasConfig and OtherConfig. In case (NG)EN-DC is configured, this also includes the entire NR SCG configuration. Such NR SCG configuration does not include the DRB configuration as configured by nr-RadioBearerConfig1 and nr-RadioBearerConfig2).
1>	if the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message includes the mobilityControlInfo:

2>	apply the corresponding default RLC configuration for the SRB specified in 9.2.1.1 for SRB1 or in 9.2.1.2 for SRB2;
2>	apply the corresponding default logical channel configuration for the SRB as specified in 9.2.1.1 for SRB1 or in 9.2.1.2 for SRB2;
2>	if the corresponding SRB was configured with NR PDCP and the UE is connected to EPC:
3>	release the NR PDCP entity and establish it with an E-UTRA PDCP entity and with the current (MCG) security configuration;
NOTE 1a:	The UE applies the LTE ciphering and integrity protection algorithms that are equivalent to the previously configured NR security algorithms.
3>	associate the RLC bearer of this SRB with the established PDCP entity;
NOTE 2:	This is to get the SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2 for handover and SRB2 for reconfiguration after reestablishment) to a known state from which the reconfiguration message can do further configuration.
2>	else if the UE is connected to 5GC:
3>	apply the corresponding default PDCP configuration for the SRB as specified in TS 38.331 [82], clause 9.2.1;
1>	for each srb-Identity value which was configured in the srb-ToAddModListExt but is not added in the RRC message configuring the full configuration:

3>	release the E-UTRA or NR PDCP entity;
3>	release the RLC entity or entities;
3>	release the DTCH logical channel;
3>	release the drb-identity;
NOTE 3:	This will retain the eps-bearerIdentity but remove the DRBs including drb-identity of these bearers from the current UE configuration and trigger the setup of the DRBs within the AS in clause 5.3.10.3 using the new configuration.

5.3.6	Counter check
5.3.6.1	General

Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure
The counter check procedure is used by E-UTRAN to request the UE to verify the amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT match with the values indicated by E-UTRAN.
NOTE:	The procedure enables E-UTRAN to detect packet insertion by an intruder (a 'man in the middle').
5.3.6.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the procedure by sending a CounterCheck message.
NOTE:	E-UTRAN may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values reaches a specific value.
5.3.6.3	Reception of the CounterCheck message by the UE
Upon receiving the CounterCheck message, the UE shall:
1>	for each DRB that is established:
2>	if no COUNT exists for a given direction (uplink or downlink) because it is a uni-directional bearer configured only for the other direction:
3>	assume the COUNT value to be 0 for the unused direction;
2>	if the drb-Identity is not included in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList:
3>	if the DRB is configured with E-UTRA PDCP:
4>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink set to the value of the corresponding COUNT;
3>	else if the DRB is configured with NR PDCP:
4>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink set to the value of TX_NEXT – 1 and RX_NEXT – 1 (specified in TS 38.323 [83]), respectively;
2>	else if, for at least one direction, the most significant bits of the COUNT are different from the value indicated in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList:
3>	if the DRB is configured with E-UTRA PDCP:
4>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink set to the value of the corresponding COUNT;
3>	else if the DRB is configured with NR PDCP:
4>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink set to the value of TX_NEXT – 1 and RX_NEXT – 1 (specified in TS 38.323 [83]), respectively;
1>	for each DRB that is included in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList in the CounterCheck message that is not established:
2>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink with the most significant bits set identical to the corresponding values in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList and the least significant bits set to zero;
1>	submit the CounterCheckResponse message to lower layers for transmission upon which the procedure ends;
5.3.7	RRC connection re-establishment
5.3.7.1	General
	
Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful
	
Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC connection re-establishment, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection, which involves the resumption of SRB1 (SRB1bis for a NB-IoT UE for which AS security has not been activated) operation, the re-activation of security (except for a NB-IoT UE for which AS security has not been activated) and the configuration of only the PCell.
Except for a NB-IoT UE for which AS security has not been activated, a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which security has been activated, may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds only if the concerned cell is prepared i.e. has a valid UE context. In case E-UTRAN accepts the re-establishment, SRB1 operation resumes while the operation of other radio bearers remains suspended. If AS security has not been activated, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly.
When AS security has not been activated, a NB-IoT UE supporting RRC connection re-establishment for the Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS optimisation in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
-	When AS security has been activated:
-	to reconfigure SRB1 and to resume data transfer only for this RB;
-	to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms.
-	For a NB-IoT UE supporting RRC connection re-establishment for the Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS optimisation, when AS security has not been activated:
-	to re-establish SRB1bis and to continue data transfer for this RB.
5.3.7.2	Initiation
The UE shall only initiate the procedure either when AS security has been activated or for a NB-IoT UE supporting RRC connection re-establishment for the Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS optimisation. The UE initiates the procedure when one of the following conditions is met:
1>	upon detecting radio link failure and T316 is not configured, in accordance with 5.3.11; or
1>	upon detecting radio link failure of the MCG while SCG transmission is suspended, in accordance with 5.3.11; or
1>	upon detecting radio link failure of the MCG while NR PSCell change or PSCell addition is ongoing, in accordance with 5.3.11; or
1>	upon handover failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.6; or
1>	upon mobility from E-UTRA failure, in accordance with 5.4.3.5; or
1>	except when resuming an RRC connection after early security reactivation in accordance with conditions in 5.3.3.18, upon integrity check failure indication from lower layers concerning SRB1 or SRB2; or
1>	upon an RRC connection reconfiguration failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.5; or
1>	upon an RRC connection reconfiguration failure, in accordance with TS38.331 [82], clause 5.3.5.8; or
1>	upon detecting radio link failure for the SCG while MCG transmission is suspended, in accordance with TS 38.331 [82] subclause 5.3.10.3 in (NG)EN-DC; or
1>	upon SCG change failure while MCG transmission is suspended, in accordance with TS 38.331 [82] subclause 5.3.5.8.3 in (NG)EN-DC; or
1>	upon SCG configuration failure while MCG transmission is suspended in accordance with subclause TS 38.331 [82] subclause 5.3.5.8.2 in (NG)EN-DC; or
1>	upon integrity check failure indication from SCG lower layers concerning SRB3 while MCG transmission is suspended; or
1>	upon T316 expiry, in accordance with subclause 5.6.26.5.
NOTE:	When resuming an RRC connection after early security reactivation in accordance with conditions in 5.3.3.18, integrity check failure indication from lower layers is handled in accordance with clause 5.3.3.16.

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501 [95] or the RRC layer.
BL UE or UE in CE in RRC_CONNECTED uses SystemInformationBlockType25, if broadcasted, acquired when entering RRC_CONNECTED or acquired while T311 is running.

5.4	Inter-RAT mobility
5.4.1	Introduction
The general principles of connected mode mobility are described in 5.3.1.3. The general principles of the security handling upon connected mode mobility are described in 5.3.1.2.
For the (network controlled) inter RAT mobility from E-UTRA for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, a single procedure is defined that supports both handover, cell change order with optional network assistance (NACC) and enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT. The same procedure also supports inter-system handover between E-UTRA/EPC and E-UTRA/5GC. In case of mobility to CDMA2000, the eNB decides when to move to the other RAT while the target RAT determines to which cell the UE shall move.
5.4.2	Handover to E-UTRA
5.4.2.1	General

Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to E-UTRA, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network, transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g. GERAN, UTRAN or NR) to E-UTRAN, or transfer a connection between the UE and the E-UTRAN with one type of CN to the E-UTRAN with a different type of CN.
The handover to E-UTRA procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination with DRBs, are established in another RAT or in E-UTRA connected to another type of CN. Handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN applies only after integrity has been activated in UTRAN. Handover to E-UTRA connected to a different type of CN applies only after integrity has been activated in E-UTRAN. Handover from NR to E-UTRAN applies only after integrity has been activated in NR.
5.4.2.2	Initiation
The RAN using another RAT or the E-UTRA connected to a different type of CN initiates the handover to E-UTRA procedure, in accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT or for the E-UTRA connected to a different type of CN, by sending the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message via the radio access technology from which the inter-RAT handover is performed.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
-	to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated in the other RAT or in the E-UTRA connected to a different type of CN;
-	to establish SRB1, SRB2 and one or more DRBs, i.e. at least the DRB associated with the default EPS bearer is established if the target CN is EPC and at least one DRB is established if the target CN is 5GC.

5.4.3	Mobility from E-UTRA
5.4.3.1	General

Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Mobility from E-UTRA, successful

Figure 5.4.3.1-2: Mobility from E-UTRA, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to move a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to a cell using another Radio Access Technology (RAT), e.g. GERAN, UTRA, CDMA2000 systems, NR, or handover a UE to an E-UTRA cell connected to another type of CN. The mobility from E-UTRA procedure covers the following type of mobility:
-	handover, i.e. the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message includes radio resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell;
-	cell change order, i.e. the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message may include information facilitating access of and/ or connection establishment in the target cell, e.g. system information. Cell change order is applicable only to GERAN; and
-	enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT, i.e. the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message includes radio resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell. The enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT may be combined with concurrent handover or redirection to CDMA2000 HRPD.
NOTE:	For the case of dual receiver/transmitter enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT, the DLInformationTransfer message is used instead of the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message (see TS 36.300 [9]).
5.4.3.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the mobility from E-UTRA procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a MeasurementReport message, in response to reception of CS fallback indication for the UE from MME, or in response to an MCGFailureInformation message by sending a MobilityFromEUTRACommand message. E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
-	the procedure is initiated only when AS-security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
-	the procedure is not initiated if any DAPS bearer is configured;
5.4.3.3	Reception of the MobilityFromEUTRACommand by the UE
The UE shall be able to receive a MobilityFromEUTRACommand message and perform a cell change order to GERAN, even if no prior UE measurements have been performed on the target cell.
The UE shall:
1>	stop timer T310, if running;
1>	stop timer T312, if running;
1>	if timer T316 is running:
2>	stop timer T316;
2>	clear the information included in VarRLF-Report, if any;
1>	if T309 is running:
2>	stop timer T309 for all access categories;
2>	perform the actions as specified in 5.3.16.4.
1>	if the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message includes the purpose set to handover:
2>	if the targetRAT-Type is set to utra or geran:
3>	consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards the RAT indicated by the targetRAT-Type included in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message;
3>	forward the nas-SecurityParamFromEUTRA to the upper layers;
3>	access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specifications of the target RAT;
3>	if the targetRAT-Type is set to geran:
4>	use the contents of systemInformation, if provided for PS Handover, as the system information to begin access on the target GERAN cell;
NOTE 1:	If there are DRBs for which no radio bearers are established in the target RAT as indicated in the targetRAT-MessageContainer in the message, the E-UTRA RRC part of the UE does not indicate the release of the concerned DRBs to the upper layers. Upper layers may derive which bearers are not established from information received from the AS of the target RAT.
NOTE 2:	In case of SR-VCC, the DRB to be replaced is specified in TS 23.216 [61].
2>	else if the targetRAT-Type is set to eutra:
3>	consider inter-system mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;
3>	forward the nas-SecurityParamFromEUTRA to the upper layers, if included;
3>	access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with clause 5.4.2.3;
2>	else if the targetRAT-Type is set to nr:
3>	consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards NR;
3>	access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specifications in TS 38.331 [82];
2>	else if the targetRAT-Type is set to cdma2000-1XRTT or cdma2000-HRPD:
3>	forward the targetRAT-Type and the targetRAT-MessageContainer to the CDMA2000 upper layers for the UE to access the cell(s) indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specifications of the CDMA2000 target-RAT;
1>	else if the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message includes the purpose set to cellChangeOrder:
2>	start timer T304 with the timer value set to t304, as included in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message;
2>	if the targetRAT-Type is set to geran:
3>	if networkControlOrder is included in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message:
4>	apply the value as specified in TS 44.060 [36];
3>	else:
4>	acquire networkControlOrder and apply the value as specified in TS 44.060 [36];
3>	use the contents of systemInformation, if provided, as the system information to begin access on the target GERAN cell;
2>	establish the connection to the target cell indicated in the CellChangeOrder;
NOTE 3:	The criteria for success or failure of the cell change order to GERAN are specified in TS 44.060 [36].
1>	if the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message includes the purpose set to e-CSFB:
2>	if messageContCDMA2000-1XRTT is present:
3>	forward the messageContCDMA2000-1XRTT to the CDMA2000 upper layers for the UE to access the cell(s) indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specification of the target RAT;
2>	if mobilityCDMA2000-HRPD is present and is set to handover:
3>	forward the messageContCDMA2000-HRPD to the CDMA2000 upper layers for the UE to access the cell(s) indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specification of the target RAT;
2>	if mobilityCDMA2000-HRPD is present and is set to redirection:
3>	forward the redirectCarrierCDMA2000-HRPD to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
NOTE 4:	When the CDMA2000 upper layers in the UE receive both the messageContCDMA2000-1XRTT and messageContCDMA2000-HRPD the UE performs concurrent access to both CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD RAT.
NOTE 5:	The UE should perform the handover, the cell change order or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback as soon as possible following the reception of the RRC message MobilityFromEUTRACommand, which could be before confirming successful reception (HARQ and ARQ) of this message.
5.4.3.4	Successful completion of the mobility from E-UTRA
Upon successfully completing the handover, the cell change order or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback, the UE shall:
1>	if the targetRAT-Type in the received MobilityFromEUTRACommand is set to eutra (intra-E-UTRA inter-system HO):
2>	indicate to the upper layers associated to the source system the release of the RRC connection together with the release cause 'other';
2>	the procedure ends;
1>	else if the UE was connected to 5GC prior to the reception of the MobilityFromEUTRACommand and the targetRAT-Type in the received MobilityFromEUTRACommand is set to nr:
2>	reset MAC;
2>	stop all timers that are running except T325, T330;
2>	release ran-NotificationAreaInfo, if stored;
2>	release the AS security context including the KRRCenc key, the KRRCint, the KUPint key and the KUPenc key, if stored;
2>	release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity, the MAC configuration and the associated PDCP entity and SDAP entity for all established RBs;
NOTE 1:	PDCP and SDAP configured by the source configurations RAT prior to the handover that are reconfigured and re-used by target RAT when delta signalling (i.e., during inter-RAT intra-system handover when fullConfig is not present) is used, are not released as part of this procedure.
1>	else:
2>	perform the actions upon leaving RRC_CONNECTED as specified in 5.3.12, with release cause 'other';
NOTE 2:	If the UE performs enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback along with concurrent mobility to CDMA2000 HRPD and the connection to either CDMA2000 1xRTT or CDMA2000 HRPD succeeds, then the mobility from E-UTRA is considered successful.
5.4.3.5	Mobility from E-UTRA failure
The UE shall:
1>	if T304 configured in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message expires (mobility from E-UTRA failure); or
1>	if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target radio access technology; or
1>	if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message; or
1>	if there is a protocol error in the inter RAT information included in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message, causing the UE to fail the procedure according to the specifications applicable for the target RAT (i.e. according to subclause 5.3.5.6 if the targetRAT-Type in the received MobilityFromEUTRACommand is set to eutra):
2>	stop T304, if running;
2>	if the cs-FallbackIndicator in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message was set to TRUE or e-CSFB was present:
3>	indicate to upper layers that the CS fallback procedure has failed;
2>	revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell, excluding the configuration configured by the physicalConfigDedicated, mac-MainConfig and sps-Config;
2>	if MobilityFromEUTRACommand concerned a failed inter-RAT handover from E-UTRA to NR and if the UE supports Radio Link Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO NR:
3>	store handover failure information in VarRLF-Report according to 5.3.5.6;
2>	initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7;
NOTE:	For enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT, the above UE behavior applies only when the UE is attempting the enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback and connection to the target radio access technology fails or if the UE is attempting enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback along with concurrent mobility to CDMA2000 HRPD and connection to both the target radio access technologies fails.
5.4.4	Handover from E-UTRA preparation request (CDMA2000)
5.4.4.1	General

Figure 5.4.4.1-1: Handover from E-UTRA preparation request
The purpose of this procedure is to trigger the UE to prepare for handover or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback to CDMA2000 by requesting a connection with this network. The UE may use this procedure to concurrently prepare for handover to CDMA2000 HRPD along with preparation for enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT. This procedure applies to CDMA2000 capable UEs only.
This procedure is also used to trigger the UE which supports dual Rx/Tx enhanced 1xCSFB to redirect its second radio to CDMA2000 1xRTT.
The handover from E-UTRA preparation request procedure applies when signalling radio bearers are established.
5.4.4.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the handover from E-UTRA preparation request procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a MeasurementReport message or CS fallback indication for the UE, by sending a HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest message. E-UTRA initiates the procedure only when AS security has been activated.
5.4.4.3	Reception of the HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest by the UE
Upon reception of the HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest message, the UE shall:
1>	if dualRxTxRedirectIndicator is present in the received message:
2>	forward dualRxTxRedirectIndicator to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
2>	forward redirectCarrierCDMA2000-1XRTT to the CDMA2000 upper layers, if included;
1>	else:
2>	indicate the request to prepare handover or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback and forward the cdma2000-Type to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
2>	if cdma2000-Type is set to type1XRTT:
3>	forward the rand and the mobilityParameters to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
2>	if concurrPrepCDMA2000-HRPD is present in the received message:
3>	forward concurrPrepCDMA2000-HRPD to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
2>	else:
3>	forward concurrPrepCDMA2000-HRPD, with its value set to FALSE, to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
5.4.5	UL handover preparation transfer (CDMA2000)
5.4.5.1	General

Figure 5.4.5.1-1: UL handover preparation transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to tunnel the handover related CDMA2000 dedicated information or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback related CDMA2000 dedicated information from UE to E-UTRAN when requested by the higher layers. The procedure is triggered by the higher layers on receipt of HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest message. If preparing for enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT and handover to CDMA2000 HRPD, the UE sends two consecutive ULHandoverPreparationTransfer messages to E-UTRAN, one per addressed CDMA2000 RAT Type. This procedure applies to CDMA2000 capable UEs only.
5.4.5.2	Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL handover preparation transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer handover or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback related non-3GPP dedicated information. The UE initiates the UL handover preparation transfer procedure by sending the ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message.
5.4.5.3	Actions related to transmission of the ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message
The UE shall set the contents of the ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message as follows:
1>	include the cdma2000-Type and the dedicatedInfo;
1>	if the cdma2000-Type is set to type1XRTT:
2>	include the meid and set it to the value received from the CDMA2000 upper layers;
1>	submit the ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
5.4.5.4	Failure to deliver the ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message
The UE shall:
1>	if the UE is unable to guarantee successful delivery of ULHandoverPreparationTransfer messages:
2>	inform upper layers about the possible failure to deliver the information contained in the concerned ULHandoverPreparationTransfer message;
5.4.6	Inter-RAT cell change order to E-UTRAN
5.4.6.1	General
The purpose of the inter-RAT cell change order to E-UTRAN procedure is to transfer, under the control of the source radio access technology, a connection between the UE and another radio access technology (e.g. GSM/ GPRS) to E-UTRAN.
5.4.6.2	Initiation
The procedure is initiated when a radio access technology other than E-UTRAN, e.g. GSM/GPRS, using procedures specific for that RAT, orders the UE to change to an E-UTRAN cell. In response, upper layers request the establishment of an RRC connection as specified in clause 5.3.3.
NOTE:	Within the message used to order the UE to change to an E-UTRAN cell, the source RAT should specify the identity of the target E-UTRAN cell as specified in the specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1>	upon receiving an RRCConnectionSetup message:
2>	consider the inter-RAT cell change order procedure to have completed successfully;
5.4.6.3	UE fails to complete an inter-RAT cell change order
If the inter-RAT cell change order fails the UE shall return to the other radio access technology and proceed as specified in the appropriate specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1>	upon failure to establish the RRC connection as specified in clause 5.3.3:
2>	consider the inter-RAT cell change order procedure to have failed;
NOTE:	The cell change was network ordered. Therefore, failure to change to the target PCell should not cause the UE to move to UE-controlled cell selection.
5.5	Measurements
5.5.1	Introduction
The UE reports measurement information in accordance with the measurement configuration and performs conditional reconfiguration evaluation in accordance with conditional reconfiguration as provided by E-UTRAN. E-UTRAN provides the measurement configuration or the conditional reconfiguration applicable for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED by means of dedicated signalling, i.e. using the RRCConnectionReconfiguration or RRCConnectionResume message.
The UE can be requested to perform the following types of measurements:
-	Intra-frequency measurements: measurements at the downlink carrier frequency(ies) of the serving cell(s).
-	Inter-frequency measurements: measurements at frequencies that differ from any of the downlink carrier frequency(ies) of the serving cell(s).
-	Inter-RAT measurements of NR frequencies.
-	Inter-RAT measurements of UTRA frequencies.
-	Inter-RAT measurements of GERAN frequencies.
-	Inter-RAT measurements of CDMA2000 HRPD or CDMA2000 1xRTT or WLAN frequencies.
-	CBR measurements for V2X sidelink communication.
-	Sensing measurements for V2X sidelink communication.
The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:
1.	Measurement objects: The objects on which the UE shall perform the measurements.
-	For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this carrier frequency, E-UTRAN can configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of 'blacklisted' cells and a list of 'whitelisted' cells. Blacklisted cells are not considered in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
-	For inter-RAT NR measurements a measurement object is a single NR carrier frequency. Associated with this carrier frequency, E-UTRAN can configure a list of 'blacklisted' cells. Blacklisted cells are not considered in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
-	For inter-RAT UTRA measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single UTRA carrier frequency.
-	For inter-RAT GERAN measurements a measurement object is a set of GERAN carrier frequencies.
-	For inter-RAT CDMA2000 measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single (HRPD or 1xRTT) carrier frequency.
-	For inter-RAT WLAN measurements a measurement object is a set of WLAN identifiers and optionally a set of WLAN frequencies.
-	For CBR measurements and sensing measurements a measurement object is a set of transmission resource pools for V2X sidelink communication.
NOTE 1:	Some measurements using the above mentioned measurement objects, only concern a single cell, e.g. measurements used to report neighbouring cell system information, PCell UE Rx-Tx time difference, or a pair of cells, e.g. SSTD measurements between the PCell and the PSCell.
2.	Reporting configurations: A list of measurement reporting configurations where each measurement reporting configuration consists of the following:
-	Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event description.
-	Reporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement report and associated information (e.g. number of cells to report).
In case of conditional handover triggering configuration, each configuration consists of the following:
-	Execution criteria: The criteria that triggers the UE to perform conditional handover.
3.	Measurement identities: For measurement reporting, a list of measurement identities where each measurement identity links one measurement object with one measurement reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity is used as a reference number in the measurement report. For conditional reconfiguration triggering, one measurement identity links to exactly one conditional reconfiguration trigger configuration. And up to two measurement identities can be linked to one conditional reconfiguration execution condition.
4.	Quantity configurations: One quantity configuration is configured per RAT type. The quantity configuration defines the measurement quantities and associated filtering used for all event evaluation and related reporting of that measurement type. One filter can be configured per measurement quantity, except for NR where the network may configure up to 2 sets of quantity configurations each comprising per measurement quantity seperate filters for cell and RS index measurement results. The quantity configuration set that applies for a given measurement is indicated within the NR measurement object.
5.	Measurement gaps: Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements, i.e. no (UL, DL) transmissions are scheduled.
E-UTRAN only configures a single measurement object for a given frequency (except for WLAN and except for CBR measurements), i.e. it is not possible to configure two or more measurement objects for the same frequency with different associated parameters, e.g. different offsets and/ or blacklists. E-UTRAN may configure multiple instances of the same event e.g. by configuring two reporting configurations with different thresholds.
The UE maintains a single measurement object list, a single reporting configuration list, and a single measurement identities list. The measurement object list includes measurement objects, that are specified per RAT type, possibly including intra-frequency object(s) (i.e. the object(s) corresponding to the serving frequency(ies)), inter-frequency object(s) and inter-RAT objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes E-UTRA and inter-RAT reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1.	The serving cell(s) - these are the PCell and one or more SCells, if configured for a UE supporting CA or DC. Likewise, NR serving cell(s) are the NR PCell, NR PSCell and NR SCells, if the UE is configured with MR-DC.
2.	Listed cells - these are cells listed within the measurement object(s) or, for inter-RAT WLAN, the WLANs matching the WLAN identifiers configured in the measurement object or the WLAN the UE is connected to.
3.	Detected cells - these are cells that are not listed within the measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the carrier frequency(ies) indicated by the measurement object(s) or, for inter-RAT WLAN, the WLANs not included in the measObjectWLAN but meeting the triggering requirements.
For E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on the serving cell(s), listed cells, detected cells, transmission resource pools for V2X sidelink communication, and, for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements, the UE measures and reports on any reception on the indicated frequency. For inter-RAT NR, the UE measures and reports on detected cells and, if configured with MR-DC, on NR serving cell(s) and, for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements, the UE measures and reports on the indicated frequency. For inter-RAT UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and optionally on cells that are within a range for which reporting is allowed by E-UTRAN. For inter-RAT GERAN, the UE measures and reports on detected cells. For inter-RAT CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports on listed cells. For inter-RAT WLAN, the UE measures and reports on listed cells.
NOTE 2:	For inter-RAT UTRA and CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports also on detected cells for the purpose of SON.
NOTE 3:	This specification is based on the assumption that typically CSG cells of home deployment type are not indicated within the neighbour list. Furthermore, the assumption is that for non-home deployments, the physical cell identity is unique within the area of a large macro cell (i.e. as for UTRAN).
Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in subclause 5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the VarMeasConfig unless explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration procedure covers the direct UE action related to the received measConfig.

where
Mn is the latest received measurement result from the physical layer;

Fn-1 is the old filtered measurement result, where F0 is set to M1 when the first measurement result from the physical layer is received; and
except for NR, a = 1/2(k/4), where k is the filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity received by the quantityConfig; for NR, a = 1/2(ki/4), where ki is the filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity of the i:th QuantityConfigNR in quantityConfigNRList, and i is indicated by quantityConfigSet in MeasObjectNR;
2>	adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are preserved at different input rates, observing that the filterCoefficient k assumes a sample rate equal to 200 ms;
NOTE 2:	If k is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.

5.5.6	Measurement related actions
5.5.6.1	Actions upon handover and re-establishment
E-UTRAN applies the handover procedure as follows:
-	when performing the handover procedure, as specified in 5.3.5.4, ensure that a measObjectId corresponding to each handover target serving frequency is configured as a result of the procedures described in this subclause and in 5.3.5.4;
-	when changing the band while the physical frequency remains unchanged, E-UTRAN releases the measObject corresponding to the source frequency and adds a measObject corresponding to the target frequency (i.e. it does not reconfigure the measObject);
E-UTRAN applies the re-establishment procedure as follows:
-	when performing the connection re-establishment procedure, as specified in 5.3.7, ensure that a measObjectId corresponding each target serving frequency is configured as a result of the procedure described in this subclause and the subsequent connection reconfiguration procedure immediately following the re-establishment procedure;
-	in the first reconfiguration following the re-establishment when changing the band while the physical frequency remains unchanged, E-UTRAN releases the measObject corresponding to the source frequency and adds a measObject corresponding to the target frequency (i.e. it does not reconfigure the measObject);
The UE shall:
1>	for each measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig:
2>	if the triggerType is set to periodical:
3>	remove this measId from the measIdList within VarMeasConfig:
1>	if the procedure was triggered due to a handover or successful re-establishment and the procedure involves a change of primary frequency, update the measId values in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig as follows:
2>	if a measObjectId value corresponding to the target primary frequency exists in the measObjectList within VarMeasConfig:
3>	for each measId value in the measIdList:
4>	if the measId value is linked to the measObjectId value corresponding to the source primary frequency:
5>	link this measId value to the measObjectId value corresponding to the target primary frequency;
4>	else if the measId value is linked to the measObjectId value corresponding to the target primary frequency:
5>	link this measId value to the measObjectId value corresponding to the source primary frequency;
2>	else:
3>	remove all measId values that are linked to the measObjectId value corresponding to the source primary frequency;

1>	stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is running, as well as associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for all measId;
1>	release the measurement gaps (configured by E-UTRA RRC), if activated;
NOTE 1:	If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, the UE resumes the inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurements after the E-UTRAN has setup the measurement gaps.
NOTE 2:	In this procedure, the UE may or may not release the measGapSharingConfig.
5.5.6.2	Speed dependant scaling of measurement related parameters
The UE shall adjust the value of the following parameter configured by the E-UTRAN depending on the UE speed: timeToTrigger. The UE shall apply 3 different levels, which are selected as follows:
The UE shall:

The purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE is going to start/stop OTDOA inter-frequency RSTD measurements which require measurement gaps as specified in TS 36.133 [16], clause 8.1.2.6. The procedure is also used to indicate to the network that the UE is going to start/stop OTDOA intra-frequency RSTD measurements which require measurement gaps. This procedure is also used to indicate to the network the measurement gap that the category M1 or M2 UE prefers to perform RSTD measurements with dense PRS configuration, as specified in TS 36.133 [16], Table 8.1.2.1-3.
NOTE:	It is a network decision to configure the measurement gap.

The UE shall:
1>	if and only if upper layers indicate to start performing inter-frequency RSTD measurements and the UE requires measurement gaps for these measurements while measurement gaps are either not configured or not sufficient:
2>	initiate the procedure to indicate start;
NOTE 1:	The UE verifies the measurement gap situation only upon receiving the indication from upper layers. If at this point in time sufficient gaps are available, the UE does not initiate the procedure. Unless it receives a new indication from upper layers, the UE is only allowed to further repeat the procedure in the same PCell once per frequency if the provided measurement gaps are insufficient.
1>	if and only if upper layers indicate to stop performing inter-frequency RSTD measurements:
2>	initiate the procedure to indicate stop;
NOTE 2:	The UE may initiate the procedure to indicate stop even if it did not previously initiate the procedure to indicate start.
5.5.7.3	Actions related to transmission of InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication message
The UE shall set the contents of InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication message as follows:
1>	if the procedure is initiated to indicate start or stop of inter-frequency RSTD measurements:
2>	set the rstd-InterFreqIndication as follows:

3>	else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of inter-frequency RSTD measurements:
4>	set the rstd-InterFreqIndication to the value stop;
1>	else:
2>	set the rstd-InterFreqIndication as follows:
3>	if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of intra-frequency RSTD measurements:
4>	set the carrierFreq in the rstd-InterFreqInfoList to the carrier frequency of the serving cell;

5.6.1	DL information transfer
5.6.1.1	General

Figure 5.6.1.1-1: DL information transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer NAS, (tunnelled) non-3GPP dedicated information or time reference information from E-UTRAN to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, or to transfer F1-C related information from IAB-donor-CU to IAB-DU via IAB-MT in RRC_CONNECTED.
5.6.1.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the DL information transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer NAS, non-3GPP dedicated information, time reference information or F1-C related information. E-UTRAN initiates the DL information transfer procedure by sending the DLInformationTransfer message.
5.6.1.3	Reception of the DLInformationTransfer by the UE

5.6.2.1	General

Figure 5.6.2.1-1: UL information transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer NAS or (tunnelled) non-3GPP dedicated information from the UE to E-UTRAN, or to transfer F1-C related information from IAB-DU to IAB-donor-CU via IAB-MT in RRC_CONNECTED.
5.6.2.2	Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL information transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer NAS, non-3GPP dedicated information, except at RRC connection establishment or resume in which case the NAS information is piggybacked to the RRCConnectionSetupComplete or RRCConnectionResumeComplete message correspondingly. In addition, an IAB-MT in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the UL information transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer F1-C related information. The UE initiates the UL information transfer procedure by sending the ULInformationTransfer message. When CDMA2000 information has to be transferred, the UE shall initiate the procedure only if SRB2 is established. When F1-C related information has to be transferred, the IAB-MT shall initiate the procedure only if SRB2 is established.
5.6.2.3	Actions related to transmission of ULInformationTransfer message

1>	if there is a need to transfer F1-C related information (applies only to IAB-MT):
2>	include the dedicatedInfoF1c;
1>	submit the ULInformationTransfer message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
5.6.2.4	Failure to deliver ULInformationTransfer message
The UE shall:
1>	if the UE is a NB-IoT UE, AS security is not started and radio link failure occurs before the successful delivery of ULInformationTransfer messages has been confirmed by lower layers; or
1>	if mobility (i.e. handover, RRC connection re-establishment) occurs before the successful delivery of ULInformationTransfer messages has been confirmed by lower layers:
2>	inform upper layers about the possible failure to deliver the information contained in the concerned ULInformationTransfer messages, unless the messages include dedicatedInfoF1c and no dedicatedInfoType is included;
5.6.2a	UL information transfer for MR-DC
5.6.2a.1	General

5.6.2a.2	Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL information transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer MR DC dedicated information as specified in TS 38.331 [82]. I.e. the procedure is not used during an RRC connection reconfiguration involving NR connection reconfiguration, in which case the MR DC information is piggybacked to the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message, except in the case the UE executes a Conditional PSCell Change.
5.6.2a.3	Actions related to transmission of ULInformationTransferMRDC message
The UE shall set the contents of the ULInformationTransferMRDC message as follows:
1>	if there is a need to transfer MR DC dedicated information:

5.6.3	UE capability transfer
5.6.3.1	General

Figure 5.6.3.1-1: UE capability transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer UE radio access capability information from the UE to E-UTRAN.
If the UE has changed its E-UTRAN radio access capabilities, the UE shall request higher layers to initiate the necessary NAS procedures (see TS 23.401 [41]) that would result in the update of UE radio access capabilities using a new RRC connection.

5.6.9	In-device coexistence indication
5.6.9.1	General

Figure 5.6.9.1-1: In-device coexistence indication
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN about (a change of) the In-Device Coexistence (IDC) problems experienced by the UE in RRC_CONNECTED, as described in TS 36.300 [9], and to provide the E-UTRAN with information in order to resolve them.
5.6.9.2	Initiation
A UE capable of providing IDC indications may initiate the procedure when it is configured to provide IDC indications and upon change of IDC problem information.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1>	if configured to provide IDC indications:
2>	if the UE did not transmit an InDeviceCoexIndication message since it was configured to provide IDC indications:
3>	if on one or more frequencies for which a measObjectEUTRA is configured, the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself; or
3>	if configured to provide IDC indications for UL CA; and if on one or more supported UL CA combination comprising of carrier frequencies for which a measurement object is configured, the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself; or
3>	if configured to provide IDC indications for MR-DC, and if on one or more supported MR-DC combination comprising of at least one E-UTRA carrier frequency for which a measurement object is configured and at least one NR carrier frequency included in candidateServingFreqListNR, the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself:
4>	initiate transmission of the InDeviceCoexIndication message in accordance with 5.6.9.3;
2>	else:
3>	if the set of frequencies, for which a measObjectEUTRA is configured and on which the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself, is different from the set indicated in the last transmitted InDeviceCoexIndication message; or

3>	if configured to provide IDC indications for UL CA; and if the victimSystemType is different from the value indicated in the last transmitted InDeviceCoexIndication message; or
3>	if configured to provide IDC indications for UL CA; and if the set of supported UL CA combinations on which the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself and that the UE includes in affectedCarrierFreqCombList according to 5.6.9.3, is different from the set indicated in the last transmitted InDeviceCoexIndication message; or

4>	initiate transmission of the InDeviceCoexIndication message in accordance with 5.6.9.3;
NOTE 1:	The term "IDC problems" refers to interference issues applicable across several subframes/slots where not necessarily all the subframes/slots are affected.
NOTE 2:	For the frequencies on which a serving cell or serving cells is configured that is activated, IDC problems consist of interference issues that the UE cannot solve by itself, during either active data exchange or upcoming data activity which is expected in up to a few hundred milliseconds.
For frequencies on which a SCell or SCells is configured that is deactivated, reporting IDC problems indicates an anticipation that the activation of the SCell or SCells would result in interference issues that the UE would not be able to solve by itself.
For a non-serving frequency, reporting IDC problems indicates an anticipation that if the non-serving frequency or frequencies became a serving frequency or serving frequencies then this would result in interference issues that the UE would not be able to solve by itself.
5.6.9.3	Actions related to transmission of InDeviceCoexIndication message
The UE shall set the contents of the InDeviceCoexIndication message as follows:

3>	else:
4>	optionally include a set of at least one NR carrier frequency included in candidateServingFreqListNR and optionally one or more E-UTRA carrier frequency for which a measurement object is configured, that is affected by IDC problems;
NOTE 1:	When sending an InDeviceCoexIndication message to inform E-UTRAN the IDC problems, the UE includes all assistance information (rather than providing e.g. the changed part(s) of the assistance information).
NOTE 2:	Upon not anymore experiencing a particular IDC problem that the UE previously reported, the UE provides an IDC indication with the modified contents of the InDeviceCoexIndication message (e.g. by an empty message).
The UE shall submit the InDeviceCoexIndication message to lower layers for transmission.

5.6.15	WLAN connection management
5.6.15.1	Introduction
WLAN connection management procedures in this clause are triggered as specified in other clauses where the UE is using a WLAN connection for LWA, RCLWI or LWIP.
The UE stores the current WLAN mobility set, which is a set of one or more WLAN identifier(s) (e.g. BSSID, SSID, HESSID) in wlan-MobilitySet in VarWLAN-MobilityConfig. This WLAN mobility set can be configured and updated by the eNB. A WLAN is considered to be inside the WLAN mobility set if its identifiers match all WLAN identifiers of at least one entry in wlan-MobilitySet and outside the WLAN mobility set otherwise. When the UE receives a new or updated WLAN mobility set, it initiates connection to a WLAN inside the WLAN mobility set, if not already connected to such a WLAN, and starts WLAN status monitoring as described in 5.6.15.4. The UE can perform WLAN mobility within the WLAN mobility set (connect or reconnect to a WLAN inside the WLAN mobility set) without any signalling to E-UTRAN.
The UE reports the WLAN connection status information to E-UTRAN as described in 5.6.15.2. The information in this report is based on the monitoring of WLAN connection as described in 5.6.15.4.

-	the procedure specified in 5.5.5 of TS 38.331 [82] for NR MeasurementReport Message.
5.6.28.2	Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL information transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer dedicated IRAT information as specified in TS 38.331 [82].
5.6.28.3	Actions related to transmission of ULInformationTransferIRAT message
The UE shall set the contents of the ULInformationTransferIRAT message as follows:
1>	if there is a need to transfer dedicated NR information:
2>	set the ul-DCCH-MessageNR to include the IRAT dedicated information to be transferred;
1>	submit the ULInformationTransferIRAT message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
5.7	Generic error handling
5.7.1	General
The generic error handling defined in the subsequent subclauses applies unless explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error handling.
The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
-	to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer syntax supported by the UE.
-	to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/ reserved value.
The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
-	as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/ reserved field.
5.7.2	ASN.1 violation or encoding error
The UE shall:
1>	when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH, CCCH, MCCH, SC-MCCH or SBCCH for which the abstract syntax is invalid, as specified in ITU-T X.680 (07/2002) [13]:
2>	ignore the message;
NOTE:	This clause applies in case one or more fields is set to a value, other than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version of the transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a field defined as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may not be possible to reliably detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message level.
5.7.3	Field set to a not comprehended value
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1>	if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not comprehend:
2>	if a default value is defined for this field:
3>	treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
2>	else if the concerned field is optional:
3>	treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the need code for absence of the concerned field;
2>	else:
3>	treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with subclause 5.7.4;
5.7.4	Mandatory field missing
The UE shall:
1>	if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message (e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field is absent or treated as absent:
2>	if the RRC message was received on DCCH or CCCH:
3>	ignore the message;
2>	else:
3>	if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a SEQUENCE OF):
4>	treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended field was not present;
3>	else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as the 'parent' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to the erroneous field:
4>	consider the 'parent' field to be set to a not comprehended value;
4>	apply the generic error handling to the subsequent 'parent' field(s), until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;
3>	else (field at message level):
4>	ignore the message;
NOTE 1:	The error handling defined in these subclauses implies that the UE ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not comprehended value.
NOTE 2:	The nested error handling for messages received on logical channels other than DCCH and CCCH applies for errors in extensions also, even for errors that can be regarded as invalid E-UTRAN operation e.g. E-UTRAN not observing conditional presence.
The following ASN.1 further clarifies the levels applicable in case of nested error handling for errors in extension fields.
-- /example/ ASN1START

-- Example with extension addition group

ItemInfoList ::=					SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..max)) OF ItemInfo

ItemInfo ::=						SEQUENCE {
	itemIdentity						INTEGER (1..max),
	field1								Field1,
	field2								Field2					OPTIONAL,			-- Need ON
	...
	[[	field3-r9						Field3-r9				OPTIONAL,			-- Cond Cond1
		field4-r9						Field4-r9				OPTIONAL			-- Need ON
	]]
}

-- Example with traditional non-critical extension (empty sequence)

BroadcastInfoBlock1 ::=				SEQUENCE {
	itemIdentity						INTEGER (1..max),
	field1								Field1,
	field2								Field2					OPTIONAL,			-- Need ON
	nonCriticalExtension				BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs	OPTIONAL
}

BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs::=	SEQUENCE {
	field3-r9							Field3-r9				OPTIONAL,			-- Cond Cond1
	field4-r9							Field4-r9				OPTIONAL,			-- Need ON
	nonCriticalExtension				SEQUENCE {}				OPTIONAL			-- Need OP
}

-- ASN1STOP

The UE shall, apply the following principles regarding the levels applicable in case of nested error handling:
-	an extension additon group is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the conditionality of field3 would result in the entire itemInfo entry to be ignored (rather than just the extension addition group containing field3 and field4)
-	a traditional nonCriticalExtension is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the conditionality of field3 would result in the entire BroadcastInfoBlock1 to be ignored (rather than just the non critical extension containing field3 and field4).
5.7.5	Not comprehended field
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1>	if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
2>	treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent;
NOTE:	This clause does not apply to the case of an extension to the value range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in clause 5.7.3.
5.8	MBMS
5.8.1	Introduction
5.8.1.1	General
In general the control information relevant only for UEs supporting MBMS is separated as much as possible from unicast control information. Most of the MBMS control information is provided on a logical channel specific for MBMS common control information: the MCCH. E-UTRA employs one MCCH logical channel per MBSFN area. In case the network configures multiple MBSFN areas, the UE acquires the MBMS control information from the MCCHs that are configured to identify if services it is interested to receive are ongoing. The action applicable when the UE is unable to simultaneously receive MBMS and unicast services is up to UE implementation. In this release of the specification, an MBMS capable UE is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service at a time, and reception of more than one MBMS service (also possibly on more than one MBSFN area) in parallel is left for UE implementation. The MCCH carries the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message, which indicates the MBMS sessions that are ongoing as well as the (corresponding) radio resource configuration. The MCCH may also carry the MBMSCountingRequest message, when E-UTRAN wishes to count the number of UEs in RRC_CONNECTED that are receiving or interested to receive one or more specific MBMS services.
A limited amount of MBMS control information is provided on the BCCH. This primarily concerns the information needed to acquire the MCCH(s). This information is carried by means of a single MBMS specific SystemInformationBlock: SystemInformationBlockType13. An MBSFN area is identified solely by the mbsfn-AreaId in SystemInformationBlockType13. At mobility, the UE considers that the MBSFN area is continuous when the source cell and the target cell broadcast the same value in the mbsfn-AreaId.
5.8.1.2	Scheduling
The MCCH information is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period. Scheduling information is not provided for MCCH i.e. both the time domain scheduling as well as the lower layer configuration are semi-statically configured, as defined within SystemInformationBlockType13.
For MBMS user data, which is carried by the MTCH logical channel, E-UTRAN periodically provides MCH scheduling information (MSI) at lower layers (MAC). This MCH information only concerns the time domain scheduling i.e. the frequency domain scheduling and the lower layer configuration are semi-statically configured. The periodicity of the MSI is configurable and defined by the MCH scheduling period.
5.8.1.3	MCCH information validity and notification of changes
Change of MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the same MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by means of SystemInformationBlockType13.
When the network changes (some of) the MCCH information, it notifies the UEs about the change during a first modification period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated MCCH information. These general principles are illustrated in figure 5.8.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate different MCCH information. Upon receiving a change notification, a UE interested to receive MBMS services acquires the new MCCH information immediately from the start of the next modification period. The UE applies the previously acquired MCCH information until the UE acquires the new MCCH information.

Figure 5.8.1.3-1: Change of MCCH Information
Indication of an MBMS specific RNTI, the M-RNTI (see TS 36.321 [6]), on PDCCH is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about an MCCH information change. When receiving an MCCH information change notification, the UE knows that the MCCH information will change at the next modification period boundary. The notification on PDCCH indicates which of the MCCHs will change, which is done by means of an 8-bit bitmap. Within this bitmap, the bit at the position indicated by the field notificationIndicator is used to indicate changes for that MBSFN area: if the bit is set to "1", the corresponding MCCH will change. No further details are provided e.g. regarding which MCCH information will change. The MCCH information change notification is used to inform the UE about a change of MCCH information upon session start or about the start of MBMS counting.
The MCCH information change notifications on PDCCH are transmitted periodically and are carried on MBSFN subframes only except on MBMS-dedicated cell or FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell where the MCCH information change is provided on non-MBSFN subframes. These MCCH information change notification occasions are common for all MCCHs that are configured, and configurable by parameters included in SystemInformationBlockType13: a repetition coefficient, a radio frame offset and a subframe index. These common notification occasions are based on the MCCH with the shortest modification period.
NOTE 1:	E-UTRAN may modify the MBMS configuration information provided on MCCH at the same time as updating the MBMS configuration information carried on BCCH i.e. at a coinciding BCCH and MCCH modification period. Upon detecting that a new MCCH is configured on BCCH, a UE interested to receive one or more MBMS services should acquire the MCCH, unless it knows that the services it is interested in are not provided by the corresponding MBSFN area.
A UE that is receiving an MBMS service via MRB shall acquire the MCCH information from the start of each modification period. A UE interested to receive MBMS from a carrier on which dl-Bandwidth included in MasterInformationBlock is set to n6 shall acquire the MCCH information at least once every MCCH modification period. A UE that is not receiving an MBMS service via MRB, as well as UEs that are receiving an MBMS service via MRB but potentially interested to receive other services not started yet in another MBSFN area from a carrier on which dl-Bandwidth included in MasterInformationBlock is other than n6, shall verify that the stored MCCH information remains valid by attempting to find the MCCH information change notification at least notificationRepetitionCoeff times during the modification period of the applicable MCCH(s), if no MCCH information change notification is received.
NOTE 2:	In case the UE is aware which MCCH(s) E-UTRAN uses for the service(s) it is interested to receive, the UE may only need to monitor change notifications for a subset of the MCCHs that are configured, referred to as the 'applicable MCCH(s)' in the above.
5.8.2	MCCH information acquisition
5.8.2.1	General

Figure 5.8.2.1-1: MCCH information acquisition
The UE applies the MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the MBMS control information that is broadcasted by the E-UTRAN. The procedure applies to MBMS capable UEs that are in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_CONNECTED.
5.8.2.2	Initiation
A UE interested to receive MBMS services shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon entering the corresponding MBSFN area (e.g. upon power on, following UE mobility) and upon receiving a notification that the MCCH information has changed. A UE that is receiving an MBMS service shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the MCCH, that corresponds with the service that is being received, at the start of each modification period.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the MCCH information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored MCCH information, i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for MCCH information and the UE discontinues using a field if it is absent in MCCH information unless explicitly specified otherwise.
5.8.2.3	MCCH information acquisition by the UE
An MBMS capable UE shall:
1>	if the procedure is triggered by an MCCH information change notification:
2>	start acquiring the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message and the MBMSCountingRequest message if present, from the beginning of the modification period following the one in which the change notification was received;
NOTE 1:	The UE continues using the previously received MCCH information until the new MCCH information has been acquired.
1>	if the UE enters an MBSFN area:
2>	acquire the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message and the MBMSCountingRequest message if present, at the next repetition period;
1>	if the UE is receiving an MBMS service:
2>	start acquiring the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message and the MBMSCountingRequest message if present, that both concern the MBSFN area of the service that is being received, from the beginning of each modification period;
5.8.2.4	Actions upon reception of the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message
No UE requirements related to the contents of this MBSFNAreaConfiguration apply other than those specified elsewhere e.g. within procedures using the concerned system information, the corresponding field descriptions.
5.8.2.5	Actions upon reception of the MBMSCountingRequest message
Upon receiving MBMSCountingRequest message, the UE shall perform the MBMS Counting procedure as specified in 5.8.4.
5.8.3	MBMS PTM radio bearer configuration
5.8.3.1	General
The MBMS PTM radio bearer configuration procedure is used by the UE to configure RLC, MAC and the physical layer upon starting and/or stopping to receive an MRB. The procedure applies to UEs interested to receive one or more MBMS services.
NOTE:	In case the UE is unable to receive an MBMS service due to capability limitations, upper layers may take appropriate action e.g. terminate a lower priority unicast service.
5.8.3.2	Initiation
The UE applies the MRB establishment procedure to start receiving a session of a service it has an interest in. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon start of the MBMS session, upon (re-)entry of the corresponding MBSFN service area, upon becoming interested in the MBMS service, upon removal of UE capability limitations inhibiting reception of the concerned service.
The UE applies the MRB release procedure to stop receiving a session. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon stop of the MBMS session, upon leaving the corresponding MBSFN service area, upon losing interest in the MBMS service, when capability limitations start inhibiting reception of the concerned service.
5.8.3.3	MRB establishment
Upon MRB establishment, the UE shall:
1>	establish an RLC entity in accordance with the configuration specified in 9.1.1.4;
1>	configure an MTCH logical channel in accordance with the received locgicalChannelIdentity, applicable for the MRB, as included in the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message;
1>	configure the physical layer in accordance with the pmch-Config, applicable for the MRB, as included in the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message;
1>	inform upper layers about the establishment of the MRB by indicating the corresponding tmgi and sessionId;
5.8.3.4	MRB release
Upon MRB release, the UE shall:
1>	release the RLC entity as well as the related MAC and physical layer configuration;
1>	inform upper layers about the release of the MRB by indicating the corresponding tmgi and sessionId;
5.8.4	MBMS Counting Procedure
5.8.4.1	General


Figure 5.8.4.1-1: MBMS Counting procedure
The MBMS Counting procedure is used by the E-UTRAN to count the number of RRC_CONNECTED mode UEs which are receiving via an MRB or interested to receive via an MRB the specified MBMS services.
The UE determines interest in an MBMS service, that is identified by the TMGI, by interaction with upper layers.
5.8.4.2	Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the procedure by sending an MBMSCountingRequest message.
5.8.4.3	Reception of the MBMSCountingRequest message by the UE
Upon receiving the MBMSCountingRequest message, the UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode shall:
1>	if the SystemInformationBlockType1, that provided the scheduling information for the systemInformationBlockType13 that included the configuration of the MCCH via which the MBMSCountingRequest message was received, contained the identity of the Registered PLMN; and
1>	if the UE is receiving via an MRB or interested to receive via an MRB at least one of the services in the received countingRequestList:
2>	if more than one entry is included in the mbsfn-AreaInfoList received in the SystemInformationBlockType13 that included the configuration of the MCCH via which the MBMSCountingRequest message was received:
3>	include the mbsfn-AreaIndex in the MBMSCountingResponse message and set it to the index of the entry in the mbsfn-AreaInfoList within the received SystemInformationBlockType13 that corresponds with the MBSFN area used to transfer the received MBMSCountingRequest message;
2>	for each MBMS service included in the received countingRequestList:
3>	if the UE is receiving via an MRB or interested to receive via an MRB this MBMS service:
4>	include an entry in the countingResponseList within the MBMSCountingResponse message with countingResponseService set it to the index of the entry in the countingRequestList within the received MBMSCountingRequest that corresponds with the MBMS service the UE is receiving or interested to receive;
2>	submit the MBMSCountingResponse message to lower layers for transmission upon which the procedure ends;
NOTE 1:	UEs that are receiving an MBMS User Service, as specified in TS 23.246 [56], by means of a Unicast Bearer Service, as specified in TS 26.346 [57], (i.e. via a DRB), but are interested to receive the concerned MBMS User Service, as specified in TS 23.246 [56], via an MBMS Bearer Service (i.e. via an MRB), respond to the counting request.
NOTE 2:	If ciphering is used at upper layers, the UE does not respond to the counting request if it can not decipher the MBMS service for which counting is performed (see TS 22.146 [62], clause 5.3).
NOTE 3:	The UE treats the MBMSCountingRequest messages received in each modification period independently. In the unlikely case E-UTRAN would repeat an MBMSCountingRequest (i.e. including the same services) in a subsequent modification period, the UE responds again. The UE provides at most one MBMSCountingResponse message to multiple transmission attempts of an MBMSCountingRequest messages in a given modification period.
5.8.5	MBMS interest indication
5.8.5.1	General
	
Figure 5.8.5.1-1: MBMS interest indication
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN that the UE is receiving or is interested to receive MBMS service(s) via an MRB or SC-MRB, and if so, to inform E-UTRAN about the priority of MBMS versus unicast reception or MBMS service(s) reception in receive only mode.
5.8.5.2	Initiation
An MBMS or SC-PTM capable UE in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure in several cases including upon successful connection establishment, upon entering or leaving the service area, upon session start or stop, upon change of interest, upon change of priority between MBMS reception and unicast reception, upon change to a PCell broadcasting SystemInformationBlockType15, upon starting and stopping of MBMS service(s) in receive only mode, upon change of receive only mode frequency, bandwidth or subcarrier spacing of MBMS service(s) in receive only mode.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1>	if SystemInformationBlockType15 is broadcast by the PCell; or
1>	if mbms-ROM-ServiceIndication is received in SystemInformationBlockType2 from PCell:
2>	ensure having a valid version of SystemInformationBlockType15 for the PCell, if present;
2>	if the UE did not transmit an MBMSInterestIndication message since last entering RRC_CONNECTED state; or
2>	if since the last time the UE transmitted an MBMSInterestIndication message, the UE connected to a PCell neither broadcasting SystemInformationBlockType15 nor including mbms-ROM-ServiceIndication in SystemInformationBlockType2:
3>	if the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with 5.8.5.3, is not empty:
4>	initiate transmission of the MBMSInterestIndication message in accordance with 5.8.5.4;
2>	else:
3>	if the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with 5.8.5.3, has changed since the last transmission of the MBMSInterestIndication message; or
3>	if at least one of the subcarrier spacing or bandwidth parameter of receive only mode MBMS frequency of interest, determined in accordance with 5.8.5.3, has changed since the last transmission of the MBMSInterestIndication message; or
3>	if the prioritisation of reception of all indicated MBMS frequencies compared to reception of any of the established unicast bearers has changed since the last transmission of the MBMSInterestIndication message:
4>	initiate transmission of the MBMSInterestIndication message in accordance with 5.8.5.4;
NOTE:	The UE may send an MBMSInterestIndication even when it is able to receive the MBMS services it is interested in i.e. to avoid that the network allocates a configuration inhibiting MBMS reception.
3>	else if SystemInformationBlockType20 is broadcast by the PCell:
4>	if since the last time the UE transmitted an MBMSInterestIndication message, the UE connected to a PCell not broadcasting SystemInformationBlockType20; or
4>	if the set of MBMS services of interest determined in accordance with 5.8.5.3a is different from mbms-Services included in the last transmission of the MBMSInterestIndication message;
5>	initiate the transmission of the MBMSInterestIndication message in accordance with 5.8.5.4.
5.8.5.3	Determine MBMS frequencies of interest
The UE shall:
1>	consider a frequency to be part of the MBMS frequencies of interest if the following conditions are met:
2>	at least one MBMS session the UE is receiving or interested to receive via an MRB or SC-MRB is ongoing or about to start; and
NOTE 1:	The UE may determine whether the session is ongoing from the start and stop time indicated in the User Service Description (USD), see TS 36.300 [9] or TS 26.346 [57].
2>	for at least one of these MBMS sessions either SystemInformationBlockType15 acquired from the PCell includes for the concerned frequency one or more MBMS SAIs as indicated in the USD for this session or this session is in receive only mode; and
NOTE 2:	The UE considers a frequency to be part of the MBMS frequencies of interest even though E-UTRAN may (temporarily) not employ an MRB or SC-MRB for the concerned session. I.e. the UE does not verify if the session is indicated on (SC-)MCCH
NOTE 3:	The UE considers the frequencies of interest independently of any synchronization state, e.g. TS 36.300 [9], Annex J.1.
2>	the UE is capable of simultaneously receiving MRBs and/or is capable of simultaneously receiving SC-MRBs on the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, regardless of whether a serving cell is configured on each of these frequencies or not; and
2>	the supportedBandCombination the UE included in UE-EUTRA-Capability contains at least one band combination including the set of MBMS frequencies of interest;
NOTE 4:	Indicating a frequency implies that the UE supports SystemInformationBlockType13 or SystemInformationBlockType20 acquisition for the concerned frequency i.e. the indication should be independent of whether a serving cell is configured on that frequency.
NOTE 5:	When evaluating which frequencies it can receive simultaneously, the UE does not take into account the serving frequencies that are currently configured i.e. it only considers MBMS frequencies it is interested to receive.
NOTE 6:	The set of MBMS frequencies of interest includes at most one frequency for a given physical frequency. The UE only considers a physical frequency to be part of the MBMS frequencies of interest if it supports at least one of the bands indicated for this physical frequency in SystemInformationBlockType1 (for serving frequency) or SystemInformationBlockType15 (for neighbouring frequencies). In this case, E-UTRAN may assume the UE supports MBMS reception on any of the bands supported by the UE (i.e. according to supportedBandCombination).
5.8.5.3a	Determine MBMS services of interest
The UE shall:
1>	consider a MBMS service to be part of the MBMS services of interest if the following conditions are met:
2>	the UE is SC-PTM capable; and
2>	the UE is receiving or interested to receive this service via an SC-MRB; and
2>	one session of this service is ongoing or about to start; and
2>	one or more MBMS SAIs in the USD for this service is included in SystemInformationBlockType15 acquired from the PCell for a frequency belonging to the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined according to 5.8.5.3.
5.8.5.4	Actions related to transmission of MBMSInterestIndication message
The UE shall set the contents of the MBMSInterestIndication message as follows:
1>	if the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with 5.8.5.3, is not empty:
2>	include mbms-FreqList and set it to include the MBMS frequencies of interest sorted by decreasing order of interest, using the EARFCN corresponding with freqBandIndicator included in SystemInformationBlockType1 (for serving frequency), if applicable, and the EARFCN(s) as included in SystemInformationBlockType15 (for neighbouring frequencies);
NOTE 1:	The EARFCN included in mbms-FreqList is merely used to indicate a physical frequency the UE is interested to receive i.e. the UE may not support the band corresponding to the included EARFCN (but it does support at least one of the bands indicated in system information for the concerned physical frequency).
2>	include mbms-Priority if the UE prioritises reception of all indicated MBMS frequencies above reception of any of the unicast bearers;
2>	if SystemInformationBlockType20 is broadcast by the PCell:
3>	include mbms-Services and set it to indicate the set of MBMS services of interest determined in accordance with 5.8.5.3a;
NOTE 2:	If the UE prioritises MBMS reception and unicast data cannot be supported because of congestion on the MBMS carrier(s), E-UTRAN may initiate release of unicast bearers. It is up to E-UTRAN implementation whether all bearers or only GBR bearers are released. E-UTRAN does not initiate re-establishment of the released unicast bearers upon alleviation of the congestion.
1>	if the UE is receiving MBMS service(s) in receive only mode:
2>	if the supportedBandCombination the UE included in UE-EUTRA-Capability contains at least one band combination including the mbms-ROM-Freq:
3>	include mbms-ROM-Freq, mbms-ROM-SubcarrierSpacing and mbms-Bandwidth;
NOTE 3:	The EARFCN included in mbms-ROM-Freq is used to indicate a physical frequency the UE is interested to receive MBMS service(s) in receive only mode and is determined based on UE implementation.
The UE shall submit the MBMSInterestIndication message to lower layers for transmission.
5.8a	SC-PTM
5.8a.1	Introduction
5.8a.1.1	General
SC-PTM control information is provided on a specific logical channel: the SC-MCCH. The SC-MCCH carries the SCPTMConfiguration message which indicates the MBMS sessions that are ongoing as well as the (corresponding) information on when each session may be scheduled, i.e. scheduling period, scheduling window and start offset. The SCPTMConfiguration message also provides information about the neighbour cells transmitting the MBMS sessions which are ongoing on the current cell. In this release of the specification, an SC-PTM capable UE is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service at a time, and reception of more than one MBMS service in parallel is left for UE implementation.
A limited amount of SC-PTM control information is provided on the BCCH or BR-BCCH. This primarily concerns the information needed to acquire the SC-MCCH.
NOTE:	For BL UEs and UEs in CE, SC-MCCH transmission uses a 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth and a maximum TBS of 936 bits, see TS 36.213 [23]. For NB-IoT UEs, the maximum TBS for SC-MCCH transmission is 680 bits, see TS 36.213 [23].
5.8a.1.2	SC-MCCH scheduling
The SC-MCCH information (i.e. information transmitted in messages sent over SC-MCCH) is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period. SC-MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio resources and MCS) are indicated on PDCCH.
5.8a.1.3	SC-MCCH information validity and notification of changes
Change of SC-MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the same SC-MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by means of SystemInformationBlockType20 (SystemInformationBlockType20-NB in NB-IoT). If H-SFN is provided in SystemInformationBlockType1-BR, modification period boundaries for BL UEs or UEs in CE are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m=0. The modification period boundaries for NB-IoT UEs are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m=0.
When the network changes (some of) the SC-MCCH information, it notifies the UEs, other than BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs, about the change in the first subframe which can be used for SC-MCCH transmission in a repetition period. LSB bit in 8-bit bitmap when set to '1' indicates the change in SC-MCCH. Upon receiving a change notification, a UE interested to receive MBMS services transmitted using SC-PTM acquires the new SC-MCCH information starting from the same subframe. The UE applies the previously acquired SC-MCCH information until the UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information.
When the network changes (some of) the SC-MCCH information for start of new MBMS service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM, it notifies BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs about the change in every PDCCH which schedules the first SC-MCCH in a repetition period in the current modification period. The notification is transmitted with 1 bit. The bit, when set to '1', indicates the start of new MBMS service(s), see TS 36.212 [22], clauses 5.3.3.1.14 and 6.4.3.3. Upon receiving a change notification, a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE interested to receive MBMS services transmitted using SC-PTM acquires the new SC-MCCH information scheduled by the PDCCH. The BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE applies the previously acquired SC-MCCH information until the BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information.
When the network changes SC-MTCH specific information e.g. start of new MBMS service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM or change of ongoing MBMS service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM, it notifies the BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs in the PDCCH which schedules the SC-MTCH in the current modification period. The notification is transmitted with a 2 bit bitmap. The LSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to '1', indicates the change of the on-going MBMS service and the MSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to '1', indicates the start of new MBMS service(s), see TS 36.212 [22], clauses 5.3.3.1.12, 5.3.3.1.13 and 6.4.3.2. In the case the network changes an on-going SC-MTCH transmission in the next modification period, it notifies the BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs in the PDCCH which schedules this SC-MTCH in the current modification period. In the case the network starts new MBMS service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM, the network notifies the UEs which have on-going SC-MTCH in the PDCCH scheduling each of the SC-MTCH. Upon receiving such notification, a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information at the start of the next modification period. The BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE applies the previously acquired SC-MCCH information until the BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information.
5.8a.1.4	Procedures
The SC-PTM capable UE receiving or interested to receive MBMS service(s) via SC-MRB applies SC-PTM procedures described in 5.8a and, except for NB-IoT UE, the MBMS interest indication procedure as specified in 5.8.5.
5.8a.2	SC-MCCH information acquisition
5.8a.2.1	General

Figure 5.8a.2.1-1: SC-MCCH information acquisition
The UE applies the SC-MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the SC-PTM control information that is broadcast by the E-UTRAN. The procedure applies to SC-PTM capable UEs that are in RRC_IDLE except for BL UEs, UEs in CE and NB-IoT UEs, performing EDT procedure. This procedure also applies to SC-PTM capable UEs that are in RRC_CONNECTED except for BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs.
5.8a.2.2	Initiation
A UE interested to receive MBMS services via SC-MRB shall apply the SC-MCCH information acquisition procedure upon entering the cell broadcasting SystemInformationBlockType20 (SystemInformationBlockType20-NB in NB-IoT) (e.g. upon power on, following UE mobility) and upon receiving a notification that the SC-MCCH information has changed. A UE, except for BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE, that is receiving an MBMS service via SC-MRB shall apply the SC-MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the SC-MCCH information that corresponds with the service that is being received, at the start of each modification period. The BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE that is receiving an MBMS service via SC-MRB shall apply the SC-MCCH information acquisition procedure upon receiving a notification that the SC-MCCH information that corresponds with the service that is being received is about to be changed. The BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE that is receiving an MBMS service via SC-MRB may apply the SC-MCCH information acquisition procedure upon receiving a notification that the SC-MCCH information is about to be changed due to start of a new service.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the SC-MCCH information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored SC-MCCH information, i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for SC-MCCH information and the UE discontinues using a field if it is absent in SC-MCCH information unless explicitly specified otherwise.
5.8a.2.3	SC-MCCH information acquisition by the UE
A SC-PTM capable UE shall:
1>	if the procedure is triggered by an SC-MCCH information change notification and the UE has no ongoing MBMS service:
2>	except for a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE, start acquiring the SCPTMConfiguration message from the subframe in which the change notification was received;
2>	for a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE, acquire the SCPTMConfiguration message scheduled by the PDCCH in which the change notification was received;
NOTE 1:	The UE continues using the previously received SC-MCCH information until the new SC-MCCH information has been acquired.
1>	if the UE enters a cell broadcasting SystemInformationBlockType20 (SystemInformationBlockType20-NB in NB-IoT):
2>	acquire the SCPTMConfiguration message at the next repetition period;
1>	if the UE is receiving an MBMS service via an SC-MRB:
2>	except for BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE, start acquiring the SCPTMConfiguration message from the beginning of each modification period;
2>	a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE shall start acquiring the SCPTMConfiguration message at the start of the next modification period upon receiving a notification that the SC-MCCH information that corresponds with the service that is being received is about to be changed;
2>	a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE may start acquiring the SCPTMConfiguration message at the start of the next modification period upon receiving a notification that the SC-MCCH information is about to be changed due to start of a new service;
5.8a.2.4	Actions upon reception of the SCPTMConfiguration message
No UE requirements related to the contents of this SCPTMConfiguration apply other than those specified elsewhere e.g. within procedures using the concerned system information, the corresponding field descriptions.
5.8a.3	SC-PTM radio bearer configuration
5.8a.3.1	General
The SC-PTM radio bearer configuration procedure is used by the UE to configure RLC, MAC and the physical layer upon starting and/or stopping to receive an SC-MRB transmitted on SC-MTCH. The procedure applies to SC-PTM capable UEs that are in RRC_IDLE and to SC-PTM capable UEs that are not BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, and are interested to receive one or more MBMS services via SC-MRB.
NOTE:	In case the UE is unable to receive an MBMS service via an SC-MRB due to capability limitations, upper layers may take appropriate action e.g. terminate a lower priority unicast service.
5.8a.3.2	Initiation
The UE applies the SC-MRB establishment procedure to start receiving a session of a MBMS service it has an interest in. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon start of the MBMS session, upon entering a cell providing via SC-MRB a MBMS service in which the UE has interest, upon becoming interested in the MBMS service, upon removal of UE capability limitations inhibiting reception of the concerned service.
The UE applies the SC-MRB release procedure to stop receiving a session. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon stop of the MBMS session, upon leaving the cell where a SC-MRB is established, upon losing interest in the MBMS service, when capability limitations start inhibiting reception of the concerned service.
5.8a.3.3	SC-MRB establishment
Upon SC-MRB establishment, the UE shall:
1>	establish an RLC entity in accordance with the configuration specified in 9.1.1.7;
1>	configure a SC-MTCH logical channel applicable for the SC-MRB and instruct MAC to receive DL-SCH on the cell where the SCPTMConfiguration message was received for the MBMS service for which the SC-MRB is established and using g-RNTI and sc-mtch-SchedulingInfo (if included) in this message for this MBMS service;
1>	configure the physical layer in accordance with the sc-mtch-InfoList, applicable for the SC-MRB, as included in the SCPTMConfiguration message;
1>	inform upper layers about the establishment of the SC-MRB by indicating the corresponding tmgi and sessionId;
5.8a.3.4	SC-MRB release
Upon SC-MRB release, the UE shall:
1>	release the RLC entity as well as the related MAC and physical layer configuration;
1>	inform upper layers about the release of the SC-MRB by indicating the corresponding tmgi and sessionId;

5.10	Sidelink
5.10.1	Introduction
The sidelink communication and associated synchronisation resource configuration applies for the frequency at which it was received/ acquired. Moreover, for a UE configured with one or more SCells, the sidelink communication and associated synchronisation resource configuration provided by dedicated signalling applies for the PCell/ the primary frequency. The sidelink discovery and associated synchronisation resource configuration applies for the frequency at which it was received/ acquired or the indicated frequency in the configuration. For a UE configured with one or more SCells, the sidelink discovery and associated synchronisation resource configuration provided by dedicated signalling applies for the PCell/ the primary frequency / any other indicated frequency.
NOTE 1:	Upper layers configure the UE to receive or transmit sidelink communication on a specific frequency, to monitor or transmit non-PS related sidelink discovery announcements on one or more frequencies or to monitor or transmit PS related sidelink discovery announcements on a specific frequency, but only if the UE is authorised to perform these particular ProSe related sidelink activities.
NOTE 2:	It is up to UE implementation which actions to take (e.g. termination of unicast services, detach) when it is unable to perform the desired sidelink activities, e.g. due to UE capability limitations.
Sidelink communication consists of one-to-many and one-to-one sidelink communication. One-to-many sidelink communication consists of relay related and non-relay related one-to-many sidelink communication. One-to-one sidelink communication consists of relay related and non-relay related one-to-one sidelink communication. In relay related one-to-one sidelink communication the communicating parties consist of one sidelink relay UE and one sidelink remote UE.
Sidelink discovery consists of public safety related (PS related) and non-PS related sidelink discovery. PS related sidelink discovery consists of relay related and non-relay related PS related sidelink discovery. Upper layers indicate to RRC whether a particular sidelink announcement is PS related or non-PS related.
Upper layers indicate to RRC whether a particular sidelink procedure is V2X related or not.
The specification covers the use of UE to network sidelink relays by specifying the additional requirements that apply for a sidelink relay UE and a sidelink remote UE, i.e. for such UEs the regular sidelink UE requirements equally apply unless explicitly stated otherwise.
NOTE 3:	In case the configurations for V2X sidelink communication are acquired from NR, the configurations for V2X sidelink communication in SystemInformationBlockType21, SystemInformationBlockType26, SL-V2X-ConfigDedicated within RRCConnectionReconfiguration used in this subclause can be provided by SIB13, SIB14, sl-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA within RRCReconfiguration as specified in TS 38.331 [82], respectively.

5.10.2	Sidelink UE information
5.10.2.1	General

Figure 5.10.2-1: Sidelink UE information
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN that the UE is interested or no longer interested to receive sidelink communication or discovery, to receive V2X sidelink communication, as well as to request assignment or release of transmission resources for sidelink communication or discovery announcements or V2X sidelink communication or sidelink discovery gaps, to report parameters related to sidelink discovery from system information of inter-frequency/PLMN cells and to report the synchronization reference used by the UE for V2X sidelink communication.
5.10.2.2	Initiation
A UE capable of sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication or sidelink discovery that is in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure to indicate it is (interested in) receiving sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication or sidelink discovery in several cases including upon successful connection establishment, upon change of interest, upon change to a PCell broadcasting SystemInformationBlockType18 or SystemInformationBlockType19 or SystemInformationBlockType21 including sl-V2X-ConfigCommon. A UE capable of sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication or sidelink discovery may initiate the procedure to request assignment of dedicated resources for the concerned sidelink communication transmission or discovery announcements or V2X sidelink communication transmission or to request sidelink discovery gaps for sidelink discovery transmission or sidelink discovery reception and a UE capable of inter-frequency/PLMN sidelink discovery parameter reporting may initiate the procedure to report parameters related to sidelink discovery from system information of inter-frequency/PLMN cells.

5.10.7.1	General

Figure 5.10.7.1-3: Synchronisation information transmission for sidelink discovery, in (partial) coverage
The purpose of this procedure is to provide synchronisation information to a UE. For sidelink discovery, the synchronisation information concerns a Sidelink Synchronisation Signal (SLSS) and, in case of PS related discovery, also timing information and some additional configuration parameters (i.e. the MasterInformationBlock-SL message), while for sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication it concerns an SLSS and the MasterInformationBlock-SL or MasterInformationBlock-SL-V2X message. A UE transmits synchronisation information either when E-UTRAN configures it to do so by dedicated signalling (i.e. network based), or when not configured by dedicated signalling (i.e. UE based) and E-UTRAN broadcasts (in coverage) or pre-configures a threshold (out of coverage).
The synchronisation information transmitted by the UE may be derived from information/ signals received from E-UTRAN (in coverage) or received from a UE acting as synchronisation reference for the transmitting UE or received from GNSS. In the remainder, the UE acting as synchronisation reference is referred to as SyncRef UE.

The MIB-SL or MIB-SL-V2X includes timing information as well as some configuration parameters and is transmitted via SL-BCH.
The MIB-SL for sidelink discovery and sidelink communication uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 40 ms without repetitions. In particular, the MIB-SL is scheduled in subframes indicated by syncOffsetIndicator-r12 i.e. for which (10*DFN + subframe number) mod 40 = syncOffsetIndicator-r12.
The MIB-SL-V2X for V2X sidelink communication uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 160 ms without repetitions. In particular, the MIB-SL-V2X is scheduled in subframes indicated by SL-OffsetIndicatorSync i.e. for which (10*DFN + subframe number) mod 160 = SL-OffsetIndicatorSync.
The sidelink common control information may change at any transmission i.e. neither a modification period nor a change notification mechanism is used.

NOTE:	If both partialSensing and randomSelection is included in resourceSelectionConfigP2X of the pool selected, the selection between partial sensing and random selection is left to UE implementation.
5.10.13.2	V2X sidelink communication transmission pool selection
For a frequency used for V2X sidelink communication, if zoneConfig is not ignored as specified in 5.10.13.1, the UE configured by upper layers for V2X sidelink communication shall only use the pool which corresponds to geographical coordinates of the UE, if zoneConfig is included in SystemInformationBlockType21 or SystemInformationBlockType26 of the serving cell (RRC_IDLE)/ PCell (RRC_CONNECTED) or in RRCConnectionReconfiguration for the concerned frequency, and the UE is configured to use resource pools provided by RRC signalling for the concerned frequency; or if zoneConfig is included in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration for the concerned frequency, and the UE is configured to use resource pools in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration for the frequency, according to 5.10.13.1. The UE shall only use the pool which is associated with the synchronization reference source selected in accordance with 5.10.8.2.
1>	if the UE is configured to transmit on p2x-CommTxPoolNormalCommon or on p2x-CommTxPoolNormal in v2x-InterFreqInfoList in SystemInformationBlockType21 or on p2x-CommTxPoolNormal in v2x-InterFreqInfoList in SystemInformationBlockType26 according to 5.10.13.1; or

1>	if zoneConfig is included in SystemInformationBlockType21 and the UE is configured to transmit on v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated for P2X related V2X sidelink communication and zoneID is not included in v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated; or
1>	if zoneConfig is not included in the entry of v2x-InterFreqInfoList for the concerned frequency and the UE is configured to transmit on v2x-CommTxPoolNormal in v2x-InterFreqInfoList or p2x-CommTxPoolNormal in v2x-InterFreqInfoList in RRCConnectionReconfiguration; or
1>	if zoneConfig is included in the entry of v2x-InterFreqInfoList for the concerned frequency and the UE is configured to transmit on p2x-CommTxPoolNormal in v2x-InterFreqInfoList in RRCConnectionReconfiguration and zoneID is not included in p2x-CommTxPoolNormal; or
1>	if zoneConfig is not included in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration for the concerned frequency and the UE is configured to transmit on v2x-CommTxPoolList in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration for the concerned frequency:
2>	select a pool associated with the synchronization reference source selected in accordance with 5.10.8.2;
NOTE 0:	If multiple pools are associated with the selected synchronization reference source, it is up to UE implementation which resource pool is selected for V2X sidelink communication transmission.
1>	if zoneConfig is included in SystemInformationBlockType21 and the UE is configured to transmit on v2x-CommTxPoolNormalCommon or v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated for non-P2X related V2X sidelink communication; or
1>	if zoneConfig is included in SystemInformationBlockType21 and the UE is configured to transmit on v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated for P2X related V2X sidelink communication and zoneID is included in v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated; or
1>	if zoneConfig is included in the entry of v2x-InterFreqInfoList for the concerned frequency and if the UE is configured to transmit on v2x-CommTxPoolNormal in v2x-InterFreqInfoList or is configured to transmit on p2x-CommTxPoolNormal in v2x-InterFreqInfoList in RRCConnectionReconfiguration and zoneID is included in p2x-CommTxPoolNormal; or
1>	if zoneConfig is included in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration for the concerned frequency and the UE is configured to transmit on v2x-CommTxPoolList in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration for the concerned frequency:
2>	select the pool configured with zoneID equal to the zone identity determined below and associated with the synchronization reference source selected in accordance with 5.10.8.2;
The UE shall determine an identity of the zone (i.e. Zone_id) in which it is located using the following formulae, if zoneConfig is included in SystemInformationBlockType21 or SystemInformationBlockType26 or in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration:
x1= FLOOR (x / L) Mod Nx;
y1= FLOOR (y / W) Mod Ny;
Zone_id = y1 * Nx + x1.
The parameters in the formulae are defined as follows:
L is the value of zoneLength included in zoneConfig in SystemInformationBlockType21 or SystemInformationBlockType26 or in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration;
W is the value of zoneWidth included in zoneConfig in SystemInformationBlockType21 or SystemInformationBlockType26 or in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration;
Nx is the value of zoneIdLongiMod included in zoneConfig in SystemInformationBlockType21 or SystemInformationBlockType26 or in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration;
Ny is the value of zoneIdLatiMod included in zoneConfig in SystemInformationBlockType21 or SystemInformationBlockType26 or in SL-V2X-Preconfiguration;
x is the geodesic distance in longitude between UE's current location and geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [80] and it is expressed in meters;
y is the geodesic distance in latitude between UE's current location and geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [80] and it is expressed in meters.
The UE shall select a pool of resources which includes a zoneID equals to the Zone_id calculated according to above mentioned formulae and indicated by v2x-CommTxPoolNormalDedicated, v2x-CommTxPoolNormalCommon, v2x-CommTxPoolNormal in v2x-InterFreqInfoList or p2x-CommTxPoolNormal in v2x-InterFreqInfoList in RRCConnectionReconfiguration, or v2x-CommTxPoolList according to 5.10.13.1.
NOTE 1:	The UE uses its latest geographical coordinates to perform resource pool selection.
NOTE 2:	If geographical coordinates are not available and zone specific TX resource pools are configured for the concerned frequency, it is up to UE implementation which resource pool is selected for V2X sidelink communication transmission.
5.10.13.3	V2X sidelink communication transmission reference cell selection
A UE capable of V2X sidelink communication that is configured by upper layers to transmit V2X sidelink communication shall:
1>	for each frequency used to transmit V2X sidelink communication, select a cell to be used as reference for synchronisation and DL measurements in accordance with the following:
2>	if the frequency concerns the primary frequency:
3>	use the PCell (RRC_CONNECTED) or the serving cell (RRC_IDLE) as reference;
2>	else if the frequency concerns a secondary frequency:
3>	use the concerned SCell as reference;
2>	else if the UE is in coverage of the concerned frequency:
3>	use the DL frequency paired with the one used to transmit V2X sidelink communication as reference;
2>	else (i.e., out of coverage on the concerned frequency):
3>	use the PCell (RRC_CONNECTED) or the serving cell (RRC_IDLE) as reference, if needed;
5.10.14	DFN derivation from GNSS
When the UE selects GNSS as the synchronization reference source, the DFN used for V2X sidelink communication is derived from the current UTC time, by the following formulae:
DFN= FLOOR (0.1*(Tcurrent –Tref–offsetDFN)) mod 1024
SubframeNumber= FLOOR (Tcurrent –Tref–offsetDFN) mod 10
Where:
Tcurrent is the current UTC time that obtained from GNSS. This value is expressed in milliseconds;
Tref is the reference UTC time 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1 January, 1900 (midnight between Thursday, December 31, 1899 and Friday, January 1, 1900). This value is expressed in milliseconds;
OffsetDFN is the value offsetDFN if configured, otherwise it is zero. This value is expressed in milliseconds.
NOTE:	In case of leap second change event, how V2X UE obtains the scheduled time of leap second change to adjust Tcurrent correspondingly is left to UE implementation. How V2X UE handles the sudden discontinuity of DFN is left to UE implementation.

5.10.16	Sidelink synchronisation information transmission for NR sidelink communication

Figure 5.10.16-1: Synchronisation information transmission for NR sidelink communication, in (partial) coverage

Figure 5.10.16-2: Synchronisation information transmission for NR sidelink communication, out of coverage
The purpose of this procedure is to provide synchronisation information to a UE.
The initiation and the procedure for the transmission of sidelink SSB follow the procedure specified for NR sidelink communication in subclause 5.8.5 of TS 38.331 [82].
NOTE:	When applying the procedure in this subclause, SystemInformationBlockType28 in Figure 5.10.16-1 corresponds to SIB12 specified in TS 38.331 [82].
6	Protocol data units, formats and parameters (tabular & ASN.1)
6.1	General
The contents of each RRC message is specified in subclause 6.2 using ASN.1 to specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further detailed information about the fields specified in the message syntax. The syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone abstract types is further specified in a similar manner in subclause 6.3.
The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available for use in the downlink direction only. The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1-1.
Table 6.1-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields to be present
Abbreviation
Meaning
Cond conditionTag
(Used in downlink only)
Conditionally present
A field for which the need is specified by means of conditions. For each conditionTag, the need is specified in a tabular form following the ASN.1 segment. In case, according to the conditions, a field is not present, the UE takes no action and where applicable shall continue to use the existing value (and/ or the associated functionality) unless explicitly stated otherwise (e.g. in the conditional presence table or in the description of the field itself).
Need OP
(Used in downlink only)
Optionally present
A field that is optional to signal. For downlink messages, the UE is not required to take any special action on absence of the field beyond what is specified in the procedural text or the field description table following the ASN.1 segment. The UE behaviour on absence should be captured either in the procedural text or in the field description.
Need ON
(Used in downlink only)
Optionally present, No action
A field that is optional to signal. If the message is received by the UE, and in case the field is absent, the UE takes no action and where applicable shall continue to use the existing value (and/ or the associated functionality).
Need OR
(Used in downlink only)
Optionally present, Release
A field that is optional to signal. If the message is received by the UE, and in case the field is absent, the UE shall discontinue/ stop using/ delete any existing value (and/ or the associated functionality).

Any field with Need ON in system information shall be interpreted as Need OR.
Need codes may not be specified for a parent extension field/ extension group, used in downlink, which includes one or more child extension fields. Upon absence of such a parent extension field/ extension group, the UE shall:
-	For each individual child extension field, including extensions that are mandatory to include in the optional group, act in accordance with the need code that is defined for the extension;
-	Apply this behaviour not only for child extension fields included directly within the optional parent extension field/ extension group, but also for extension fields defined at further nesting levels as long as for none of the fields in-between the concerned extension field and the parent extension field a need code is specified;
NOTE 1:	The above applies for groups of non critical extensions using double brackets (referred to as extension groups), as well as non-critical extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent extension fields).
Need codes, conditions and ASN.1 defaults specified for a particular (child) field only apply in case the (parent) field including the particular field is present. This rule does not apply for optional parent extension fields/ extension groups without need codes,
NOTE 2:	The previous rule implies that E-UTRAN has to include such a parent extension field to release a child field that is either:
-	Optional with need OR, or
-	Conditional while the UE releases the child field when absent.
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::=					SEQUENCE {
	field1									InformationElement1,
	field2									InformationElement2				OPTIONAL,	-- Need ON
	nonCriticalExtension					RRCMessage-v8a0-IEs				OPTIONAL
}

RRCMessage-v8a0-IEs ::=					SEQUENCE {
	field3									InformationElement3				OPTIONAL,	-- Need ON
	nonCriticalExtension					RRCMessage-v940-IEs				OPTIONAL
}

RRCMessage-v940-IEs ::=					SEQUENCE {
	field4									InformationElement4				OPTIONAL,	-- Need OR
	nonCriticalExtension					SEQUENCE {}						OPTIONAL
}

InformationElement1 ::=				SEQUENCE {
	field11								InformationElement11				OPTIONAL,	-- Need ON
	field12								InformationElement12				OPTIONAL,	-- Need OR
	...,
	[[	field13								InformationElement13			OPTIONAL,	-- Need OR
		field14								InformationElement14			OPTIONAL	-- Need ON
	]]
}

InformationElement2 ::=			SEQUENCE {
	field21								InformationElement11				OPTIONAL,	-- Need OR
	...
}

-- ASN1STOP

The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:
-	if field2 in RRCMessage-r8-IEs is absent, the UE does not modify field21;
-	if field2 in RRCMessage-r8-IEs is present but does not include field21, the UE releases field21;
-	if the extension group containing field13 is absent, the UE releases field13 and does not modify field14;
-	if nonCriticalExtension defined by IE RRCMessage-v8a0-IEs is absent, the UE does not modify field3 and releases field4;
In the ASN.1 of this specification, the first bit of a bit string refers to the leftmost bit, unless stated otherwise.

DLDedicatedMessageSegment field descriptions
segmentNumber
Identifies the sequence number of a segment within the encoded DL DCCH message. The network transmits the segments with continuously increasing segmentNumber order so that the UE's RRC layer may expect to obtain them from lower layers in the correct order. Hence, the UE is not required to perform segment re-ordering on RRC level.
rrc-MessageSegmentContainer
Includes a segment of the encoded DL DCCH message. The size of the included segment in this container should be small enough so the resulting encoded RRC message PDU is less than or equal to the PDCP SDU size limit.
rrc-MessageSegmentType
Indicates whether the included DL DCCH message segment is the last segment of the message or not.

–	DLInformationTransfer
The DLInformationTransfer message is used for the downlink transfer of NAS, non-3GPP dedicated information, IAB-DU specific F1-C related information, or time reference information.
NOTE:	The UE may use the time reference information provided in the timeReferenceInfo IE for numerous purposes, possibly involving upper layers e.g. to synchronise the UE clock.
Signalling radio bearer: SRB2 or SRB1. If only timeReferenceInfo is included in the message, SRB1 is used. Otherwise, SRB1 is used only if SRB2 not established yet, and if SRB2 is suspended, E-UTRAN does not send this message until SRB2 is resumed. If only dedicatedInfoF1c is included, SRB2 is used.

InDeviceCoexIndication field descriptions
AffectedCarrierFreq
If carrierFreq-v1310 is included, carrierFreq-r11 is ignored by eNB.
affectedCarrierFreqCombList
Indicates a list of E-UTRA carrier frequencies that are affected by IDC problems due to Inter-Modulation Distortion and harmonics from E-UTRA when configured with UL CA. affectedCarrierFreqCombList-r13 is used when more than 5 serving cells are configured or affected combinations contain MeasObjectId larger than 32. If affectedCarrierFreqCombList-r13 is included, affectedCarrierFreqCombList-r11 shall not be included.
affectedCarrierFreqCombMRDC
Indicates a set of at least one NR carrier frequency and optionally one or more E-UTRA carrier frequency that is affected by IDC problems due to Inter-Modulation Distortion and harmonics when configured with MR-DC.
affectedCarrierFreqList
List of E-UTRA carrier frequencies affected by IDC problems. If E-UTRAN includes affectedCarrierFreqList-v1310 it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in affectedCarrierFreqList-r11.
drx-ActiveTime
Indicates the desired active time that the E-UTRAN is recommended to configure. Value in number of subframes. Value sf20 corresponds to 20 subframes, sf30 corresponds to 30 subframes and so on.
drx-CycleLength
Indicates the desired DRX cycle length that the E-UTRAN is recommended to configure. Value in number of subframes. Value sf40 corresponds to 40 subframes, sf64 corresponds to 64 subframes and so on.
drx-Offset
Indicates the desired DRX starting offset that the E-UTRAN is recommended to configure. The UE shall set the value of drx-Offset smaller than the value of drx-CycleLength. The starting frame and subframe satisfy the relation: [(SFN * 10) + subframe number] modulo (drx-CycleLength) = drx-Offset.
hardwareSharingProblem
Indicates whether the UE has hardware sharing problems that the UE cannot solve by itself. The field is present (i.e. value true), if the UE has such hardware sharing problems. Otherwise the field is absent.
idc-SubframePatternList
A list of one or more subframe patterns indicating which HARQ process E-UTRAN is requested to abstain from using. Value 0 indicates that E-UTRAN is requested to abstain from using the subframe. For FDD, the radio frame in which the pattern starts (i.e. the radio frame in which the first/leftmost bit of the subframePatternFDD corresponds to subframe #0) occurs when SFN mod 2 = 0. For TDD, the first/leftmost bit corresponds to the subframe #0 of the radio frame satisfying SFN mod x = 0, where x is the size of the bit string divided by 10. The UE shall indicate a subframe pattern that follows HARQ time line, as specified in TS 36.213 [23], i.e, if a subframe is set to 1 in the subframe pattern, also the corresponding subframes carrying the potential UL grant, as specified in TS 36.213 [23], clause 8.0, the UL HARQ retransmission, as specified in TS 36.213 [23], clause 8.0, and the DL/UL HARQ feedback, as specified in TS 36.213 [23], clauses 7.3, 8.3 and 9.1.2, shall be set to 1.
interferenceDirection
Indicates the direction of IDC interference. Value eutra indicates that only E-UTRA is victim of IDC interference, value other indicates that only another radio is victim of IDC interference and value both indicates that both E-UTRA and another radio are victims of IDC interference. The other radio refers to either the ISM radio or GNSS (see TR 36.816 [63]).
interferenceDirectionMRDC
Indicates the direction of IDC interference. Value eutra-nr indicates E-UTRA and NR is victim, value nr indicates NR, value other indicates other radio system and so on. The other radio refers to either the ISM radio or GNSS (see TR 36.816 [63]).
victimSystemType
Indicate the list of victim system types to which IDC interference is caused from E-UTRA when configured with UL CA or from E-UTRA and NR when configured with MR-DC. gps, glonass, bds, galileo, and navic indicate the type of GNSS. Value wlan indicates WLAN and value bluetooth indicates Bluetooth.

–	InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication
The InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication message is used to indicate that the UE is going to either start or stop OTDOA inter-frequency RSTD measurement which requires measurement gaps as specified in TS 36.133 [16], clause 8.1.2.6. The InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication message is also used to indicate to the network that the UE is going to start/stop OTDOA intra-frequency RSTD measurements which require measurement gaps. The InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication message is also used to indicate to the network the measurement gap that the category M1 or M2 UE prefers to perform RSTD measurements with dense PRS configuration, as specified in TS 36.133 [16], Table 8.1.2.1-3.

InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication field descriptions
carrierFreq
The EARFCN value of the carrier received from upper layers for which the UE needs to perform the inter-frequency RSTD measurements. If the UE includes carrierFreq-v1090, it shall set carrierFreq-r10 to maxEARFCN. In case the UE starts intra-frequency RSTD measurements the carrierFreq indicates the carrier frequency of the serving cell.
measPRS-Offset
Indicates the requested gap offset for performing inter-frequency or intra-frequency RSTD measurements. It is the smallest subframe offset from the beginning of subframe 0 of SFN=0 of the serving cell of the requested gap for measuring PRS positioning occasions in the carrier frequency carrierFreq for which the UE needs to perform the inter-frequency or intra-frequency RSTD measurements. The PRS positioning occasion information is received from upper layers. The value of measPRS-Offset-r10 is obtained by mapping the starting subframe of the PRS positioning occasion in the measured cell onto the corresponding subframe in the serving cell and is calculated as the serving cell's number of subframes from SFN=0 mod 40.
If measPRS-Offset-r15 is included, the field further indicates the requested gap pattern that the category M1 or M2 UE prefers to perform RSTD measurements with dense PRS configuration, as specified in TS 36.133 [16], Table 8.1.2.1-3, where value rstd0 corresponds to Gap Pattern Id rstd0, value rstd1 corresponds to Gap Pattern Id rstd1 and so on. The value of measPRS-Offset-r15 is obtained by mapping the starting subframe of the PRS positioning occasion in the measured cell onto the corresponding subframe in the serving cell and is calculated as the serving cell's number of subframes from SFN=0 mod MGRP corresponding to the requested Gap pattern Id. If measPRS-Offset-r15 is included, measPRS-Offset-r10 is ignored.
The UE shall take into account any additional time required by the UE to start PRS measurements on the other carrier when it does this mapping for determining the measPRS-Offset.
NOTE: Figure 6.2.2-1 illustrates the measPRS-Offset field.
rstd-InterFreqIndication
Indicates the inter-frequency or intra-frequency RSTD measurement action, i.e. the UE is going to start or stop inter-frequency or intra-frequency RSTD measurement.

MobilityFromEUTRACommand field descriptions
bandIndicator
Indicates how to interpret the ARFCN of the BCCH carrier.
carrierFreq
contains the carrier frequency of the target GERAN cell.
cs-FallbackIndicator
Value true indicates that the CS fallback procedure to UTRAN or GERAN is triggered.
messageContCDMA2000-1XRTT
This field contains a message specified in CDMA2000 1xRTT standard that either tells the UE to move to specific 1xRTT target cell(s) or indicates a failure to allocate resources for the enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT.
messageContCDMA2000-HRPD
This field contains a message specified in CDMA2000 HRPD standard that either tells the UE to move to specific HRPD target cell(s) or indicates a failure to allocate resources for the handover to CDMA2000 HRPD.
mobilityCDMA2000-HRPD
This field indicates whether or not mobility to CDMA2000 HRPD is to be performed by the UE and it also indicates the type of mobility to CDMA2000 HRPD that is to be performed; If this field is not present the UE shall perform only the enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT.
nas-SecurityParamFromEUTRA
If the targetRAT-Type is set to "eutra" and the source CN is 5GC, this field is used to deliver the key synchronisation and key freshness for the Key freshness for the 5GS to EPS handovers as specified in TS 33.501 [86] and the content of the parameter is defined in TS 24.501 [95]. Otherwise, this field is used to deliver the key synchronisation and Key freshness for the E-UTRAN to UTRAN handovers as specified in TS 33.401 [32] and the content of the parameter is defined in TS24.301 [35].
networkControlOrder
Parameter NETWORK_CONTROL_ORDER in TS 44.060 [36].
purpose
Indicates which type of mobility procedure the UE is requested to perform. EUTRAN always applies value e-CSFB in case of enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 (e.g. also when that procedure results in handover to CDMA2000 1XRTT only, in handover to CDMA2000 HRPD only or in redirection to CDMA2000 HRPD only),
redirectCarrierCDMA2000-HRPD
The redirectCarrierCDMA2000-HRPD indicates a CDMA2000 carrier frequency and is used to redirect the UE to a HRPD carrier frequency.
smtc
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for inter-RAT handover to NR. It is based on timing reference of EUTRA PCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.
SystemInfoListGERAN
If purpose = CellChangeOrder and if the field is not present, the UE has to acquire SI/PSI from the GERAN cell.
t304
Timer T304 as described in clause 7.3. Value ms100 corresponds with 100 ms, ms200 corresponds with 200 ms and so on. EUTRAN includes extended value ms10000-v1310 only when UE supports CE.
targetRAT-Type
Indicates the target RAT type.
targetRAT-MessageContainer
The field contains a message specified in another standard, as indicated by the targetRAT-Type, and carries information about the target cell identifier(s) and radio parameters relevant for the target radio access technology. NOTE 1.

A complete message is included, as specified in the other standard.

Conditional presence
Explanation
concHO
The field is mandatory present if the mobilityCDMA2000-HRPD is set to "handover"; otherwise the field is optional present, need ON.
concRedir
The field is mandatory present if the mobilityCDMA2000-HRPD is set to "redirection"; otherwise the field is not present.
GERAN
The field should be present if the purpose is set to "handover" and the targetRAT-Type is set to "geran"; otherwise the field is not present
PSHO
The field is mandatory present in case of PS handover toward GERAN; otherwise the field is optionally present, but not used by the UE
UTRAGERANEPC
The field is mandatory present if the targetRAT-Type is set to "utra" or "geran" or if the targetRAT-Type is set to "eutra" and the source CN is 5GC; otherwise the field is not present

NOTE 1:	The correspondence between the value of the targetRAT-Type, the standard to apply and the message contained within the targetRAT-MessageContainer is shown in the table below:

This field is used to configure the UE with a conditional reconfiguration. The reconfiguration is applied when the execution condition(s) is fulfilled. The field is absent if daps-HO is configured for any DRB or if MobilityControlInfo is included in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message. The conditionalReconfiguration is not configured in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message included in a conditionalReconfiguration.
daps-SourceRelease
A one-shot field that indicates that the UE shall release the resources associated with source PCell at a DAPS HO, including reconfiguration of the PDCP entity to release DAPS.
dedicatedInfoNASList
This field is used to transfer UE specific NAS layer information between the network and the UE. The RRC layer is transparent for each PDU in the list. If dedicatedInfoNASList-r15 is present, UE shall ignore the dedicatedInfoNASList (without suffix).
endc-ReleaseAndAdd
A one-shot field indicating whether the UE simultaneously releases and adds all the NR SCG related configuration within nr-Config, i.e. the configuration set by the NR RRCReconfiguration message (e.g. secondaryCellGroup, SRB3 and measConfig).
fullConfig
Indicates the full configuration option is applicable for the RRC Connection Reconfiguration message for intra-system intra-RAT handover. For inter-RAT handover from NR to E-UTRA, fullConfig indicates whether or not delta signalling of SDAP/PDCP from source RAT is applicable. This field is absent when the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message is generated by the E-UTRA SCG.
keyChangeIndicator
If UE is connected to EPC, true is used only in an intra-cell handover when a KeNB key is derived from a KASME key taken into use through the latest successful NAS SMC procedure, as described in TS 33.401 [32] for KeNB re-keying. false is used in an intra-LTE handover when the new KeNB key is obtained from the current KeNB key or from the NH as described in TS 33.401 [32].
If UE is connected to 5GC, with keyChangeIndicator-r15, true is used in an intra-cell handover when a KeNB key is derived from a KAMF key taken into use through the latest successful NAS SMC procedure, as described in TS 33.501 [86] for KeNB re-keying.
False is used for intra-system handover when the new KeNB key is obtained from the current KeNB key or from the NH as described in TS 33.501 [86]. True is also used in NG based handover procedure with KAMF change, when a KeNB key is derived from the new KAMF key as described in TS 33.501 [86].
lwa-Configuration
This field is used to provide parameters for LWA configuration. E-UTRAN does not simultaneously configure LWA with DC, LWIP or RCLWI for a UE.

The RRC layer is transparent for this field, although, if included, it affects activation of AS- security after handover within E-UTRA/5GC. The content is defined in TS 24.501 [95]. In case of NG based handover, the content of nas-Container is. the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE. In case of inter-system handover to from 5GS to EPS, the content of NAS-Container is. the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE.
nas-securityParamToEUTRA
This field is used to transfer UE specific NAS layer information between the network and the UE. The RRC layer is transparent for this field, although, if included, it affects activation of AS- security after inter-RAT handover to E-UTRA/EPC or inter-system handover to E-UTRA/EPC. The content is defined in TS 24.301 [35]. This field is not used for handover from 5GC.

Indicates the SCell group to be released.
sCellState
A one-shot field that indicates whether the SCell shall be considered to be in activated or dormant state upon SCell configuration.
sCellToAddModList, sCellToAddModListExt
Indicates the SCell to be added or modified. E-UTRAN uses field sCellToAddModList-r10 to add or modify SCells (with sCellIndex-r10) for a UE that does not support carrier aggregation with more than 5 component carriers.

sCellToAddModListSCG, sCellToAddModListSCG-Ext
Indicates the SCG cell to be added or modified. The field is used for SCG cells other than the PSCell (which is added/ modified by field pSCellToAddMod). E-UTRAN uses field sCellToAddModListSCG-r12 to add or modify SCells (with sCellIndex-r10) for a UE that does not support carrier aggregation with more than 5 component carriers. If E-UTRAN includes sCellToAddModListSCG-v10l0 it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in sCellToAddModListSCG-r12. If E-UTRAN includes sCellToAddModListSCG-Ext-v1370 it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in sCellToAddModListSCG-Ext-r13. If E-UTRAN includes sCellToAddModListSCG-Ext-v13c0 it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in sCellToAddModListSCG-Ext-r13.
sCellToReleaseList, sCellToReleaseListExt
Indicates the SCell to be released. E-UTRAN uses field sCellToReleaseList-r10 to release SCells for a UE that does not support carrier aggregation with more than 5 component carriers.
sCellToReleaseListSCG, sCellToReleaseListSCG-Ext
Indicates the SCG cell to be released. The field is also used to release the PSCell e.g. upon change of PSCell, upon system information change for the PSCell. E-UTRAN uses field sCellToReleaseListSCG-r12 to release SCells for a UE that does not support carrier aggregation with more than 5 component carriers.
scg-Configuration
Covers the SCG configuration as used in case of DC and NE-DC. When the UE is configured with NE-DC, E-UTRAN neither applies value release nor configures scg-ConfigPartMCG. When resuming a connection with NE-DC, this field is included, containing at least the mobilityControlInfoSCG.
scg-Counter
A counter used upon initial configuration of SCG security as well as upon refresh of S-KeNB. E-UTRAN includes the field upon SCG change when one or more SCG DRBs are configured. Otherwise E-UTRAN does not include the field.
securityConfigHO
This field contains the parameters required to update the security keys at handover. If E-UTRAN includes the securityConfigHO (i.e., without suffix), the choice intraLTE is used for handover within E-UTRA/EPC while the choice interRAT is used for handover from GERAN or UTRAN to E-UTRA/EPC. If E-UTRAN includes the securityConfigHO-v1530 (i.e., with suffix), the choice intra5GC is used for handover from NR or E-UTRA/5GC to E-UTRA/5GC while the choice fivegc-ToEPC is used for inter-system handover from NR or E-UTRA/5GC to E-UTRA/EPC and the choice epc-To5GC is used for inter-system handover from E-UTRA/EPC to E-UTRA/5GC.
sk-Counter
A one-shot counter used upon initial configuration of S-KgNB as well as upon refresh of S-KgNB. E-UTRAN always provides this field either upon initial configuration of an NR SCG, or upon configuration of the first (SN terminated) RB using S-KgNB, whichever happens first.
sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR
Container for providing the dedicated configurations for NR sidelink communication, the octet string contains the NR RRCReconfiguration message as specified in TS 38.331 [82]. In this version of the specification, the NR RRC message only includes fields related to NR sidelink communication, i.e. sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, measConfig and/or otherConfig. If the UE is configured by the current Pcell with sl-ScheduledConfig set to setup (i.e., NR sidelink communication mode 1), the network only includes sl-PrioritizationThres and sl-ConfiguredGrantConfig that only includes the configurations of configured sidelink grant Type 1 in the field sl-ScheduledConfig.
sl-SSB-PriorityEUTRA
Indicates the priority of LTE PSSS/SSSS/PSBCH transmission and reception. NOTE 3.
sl-V2X-ConfigDedicated
Indicates sidelink configuration for non-P2X related V2X sidelink communication as well as P2X related V2X sidelink communication.
smtc
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR PSCell addition and SN change. It is based on timing reference of EUTRA PCell. NOTE 2.
If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.
srs-SwitchFromServCellIndex
Indicates the serving cell whose UL transmission may be interrupted during SRS transmission on a PUSCH-less cell. During SRS transmission on a PUSCH-less cell, the UE may temporarily suspend the UL transmission on a serving cell with PUSCH in the same CG to allow the PUSCH-less cell to transmit SRS. The PUSCH-less cell is always a TDD cell but the serving cell with PUSCH may be either a FDD or TDD cell.
systemInformationBlockType1Dedicated
This field is used to transfer SystemInformationBlockType1 or SystemInformationBlockType1-BR to the UE.
systemInformationBlockType2Dedicated
This field is used to transfer BR version of SystemInformationBlockType2 to BL UEs or UEs in CE or SystemInformationBlockType2 to non-BL UEs.
t350
Timer T350 as described in clause 7.3. Value minN corresponds to N minutes.
tdm-PatternConfig
This field is used when power control or IMD issues require single UL transmission in (NG)EN-DC as specified in TS 38.101-3 [101] and TS 38.213 [88].
tdm-PatternConfig2
This field is used for dual UL transmission in EN-DC with LTE FDD PCell and for single UL transmission in EN-DC with LTE FDD/TDD PCell, as specified in TS 38.101-3 [101] and TS 38.213 [88].
The network sets at most one of tdm-PatternConfig and tdm-PatternConfig2 to setup.

NOTE 1:	Fields sk-Counter and nr-RadioBearerConfig1/ 2 are placed outside nr-Config, as these may be configured while the UE is not configured with (NG)EN-DC.
NOTE 2:	It is not specified whether the timing reference for the SMTC configuration is the source EUTRA PCell or the target EUTRA PCell in case the NR PSCell addition or SN change takes place simultaneously with handover. As a consequence, explicit SMTC configuration is only supported when the source EUTRA PCell and the target EUTRA PCell of the handover are SFN/subframe-synchronized.
NOTE 3:	For UEs in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or out-of coverage, and for the case that sl-SSB-PriorityEUTRA is absent, it is up to UE implementation to decide the priority of LTE PSSS/SSSS/PSBCH transmission and reception.

RRCConnectionRelease field descriptions
altFreqPriorities
Indicates that the UE shall apply the alternative cell reselectionpriorities, when available. This field is not configured together with idleModeMobilityControlInfo.
carrierFreq or bandClass
The carrier frequency (UTRA, E-UTRA, and NR) and band class (HRPD and 1xRTT) for which the associated cellReselectionPriority is applied. For NR, the ARFCN-ValueNR corresponds to a GSCN value as specified in TS 38.101 [85].
carrierFreqs
The list of GERAN carrier frequencies organised into one group of GERAN carrier frequencies.
cellInfoList
Used to provide system information of one or more cells on the redirected inter-RAT carrier frequency. The system information can be used if, upon redirection, the UE selects an inter-RAT cell indicated by the physCellId and carrierFreq (GERAN and UTRA TDD) or by the physCellId (other RATs). The choice shall match the redirectedCarrierInfo. In particular, E-UTRAN only applies value utra-TDD-r10 in case redirectedCarrierInfo is set to utra-TDD-r10.
cellList
Indicates a list of cells configured as RAN area. For each element, in the absence of plmn-Identity the UE considers the registered PLMN. Total number of cells across all PLMNs does not exceed 32.
cn-Type
The cn-Type is used to indicate that the UE is redirected from 5GC to EPC or 5GC when redirectedCarrierInfo indicates E-UTRA frequency.
drb-ContinueROHC
This field indicates whether to continue or reset the header compression protocol context for the DRBs configured with the header compression protocol. Presence of the field indicates that the header compression protocol context continues when UE initiates UP-EDT in the same cell, while absence indicates that the header compression protocol context is reset. 
dummy
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
extendedWaitTime
Value in seconds for the wait time for Delay Tolerant access requests.
freqPriorityListX
Provides a cell reselection priority for each frequency, by means of separate lists for each RAT (including E-UTRA). The UE shall be able to store at least 3 occurrences of FreqsPriorityGERAN. If E-UTRAN includes freqPriorityListEUTRA-v9e0 and/or freqPriorityListEUTRA-v1310 it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in freqPriorityListEUTRA (i.e. without suffix). Field freqPriorityListExt includes additional neighbouring inter-frequencies, i.e. extending the size of the inter-frequency carrier list using the general principles specified in 5.1.2. EUTRAN only includes freqPriorityListExtEUTRA if freqPriorityListEUTRA (i.e without suffix) includes maxFreq entries. If E-UTRAN includes freqPriorityListExtEUTRA-v1310 it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in freqPriorityListExtEUTRA-r12.
idleModeMobilityControlInfo
Provides dedicated cell reselection priorities. Used for cell reselection as specified in TS 36.304 [4]. For E-UTRA and UTRA frequencies, a UE that supports multi-band cells for the concerned RAT considers the dedicated priorities to be common for all overlapping bands (i.e. regardless of the ARFCN that is used).
measIdleConfig
Indicates a one-shot measurement configuration to be stored and used by the UE while in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.
mpsPriorityIndication
Indicates the UE can set the establishment cause to highPriorityAccess for a new connection to a new RAT following a redirect to E-UTRA. If the target RAT is NR, see TS 38.331 [82]. The eNB/ng-eNB sets the indication only for UEs authorized to receive MPS treatment as indicated by ARP and/or QoS characteristics at the eNB/ng-eNB, and it is applicable only for this instance of release with redirection to carrier/RAT included in the redirectedCarrierInfo field in the RRCConnectionRelease message.
noLastCellUpdate
Presence of the field indicates that the last used cell for (G)WUS shall not be updated.
periodic-RNAU-timer
Refers to the timer that triggers the periodic RNAU procedure in UE. Value min5 corresponds to 5 minutes, value min10 corresponds to 10 minutes and so on.
ran-Area
Indicates whether TA code(s) or RAN area code(s) are used for the RAN notification area. The network uses only TA code(s) or RAN area code(s) to configure a UE. Total number of TACs across all PLMNs does not exceed 16. Total number of RAN-AreaCode across all PLMNs does not exceed 32.
ran-NotificationAreaInfo
Network ensures that the UE in RRC_INACTIVE always has a valid ran-NotificationAreaInfo.
ranAreaConfigList
Indicates a list of RAN area codes or RA code(s) as RAN area. For each element, in the absence of plmn-Identity the UE considers the registered PLMN.
ran-pagingCycle
Refers to the UE specific cycle for RAN-initiated paging. Value rf32 corresponds to 32 radio frames, rf64 corresponds to 64 radio frames and so on.
redirectedCarrierInfo
The redirectedCarrierInfo indicates a carrier frequency (downlink for FDD) and is used to redirect the UE to an E‑UTRA or an inter-RAT carrier frequency, by means of the cell selection upon leaving RRC_CONNECTED as specified in TS 36.304 [4]. The value geran can only be included after successful security activation when UE is connected to 5GC.
releaseCause
The releaseCause is used to indicate the reason for releasing the RRC Connection. The cause value cs-FallbackHighPriority is only applicable when redirectedCarrierInfo is present with the value set to utra-FDD, utra-TDD or utra-TDD-r10. E-UTRAN should not set the releaseCause to loadBalancingTAURequired or to cs-FallbackHighPriority if the extendedWaitTime is present. The network should not set the releaseCause to loadBalancingTAURequired if the UE is connected to 5GC. The network does not set the releaseCause to rrc-Suspend if the UE is configured with a DAPS bearer, i.e. if source PCell resources after a DAPS handover have not been released.
releaseIdleMeasConfig
Indicates that the UE shall release the idle/inactive measurement configurations, if configured.
rrc-InactiveConfig
Indicates configuration for the RRC_INACTIVE state. The network does not configure this field when the UE is redirected to an inter-RAT carrier frequency or if the UE is configured with a DAPS bearer.
smtc
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of the redirected target NR frequency. It is based on the timing reference of EUTRAN PCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC configured in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing
subcarrierSpacingSSB
Indicate subcarrier spacing of SSB of redirected target NR frequency. Only the values 15 or 30 (<6GHz), 120 kHz or 240 kHz (>6GHz) are applicable.
systemInformation
Container for system information of the GERAN cell i.e. one or more System Information (SI) messages as defined in TS 44.018 [45], table 9.1.1. 
t320
Timer T320 as described in clause 7.3. Value minN corresponds to N minutes.
t323
Timer T323 as described in clause 7.3. Value minN corresponds to N minutes.

Indicates the frequency on which the UE is interested to transmit non-relay related sidelink communication as well as the one-to-many sidelink communication transmission destination(s) for which the UE requests E-UTRAN to assign dedicated resources. NOTE 1.
commTxResourceReqRelay
Indicates the relay related one-to-many sidelink communication transmission destination(s) for which the sidelink relay UE requests E-UTRAN to assign dedicated resources.
commTxResourceReqRelayUC
Indicates the relay related one-to-one sidelink communication transmission destination(s) for which the sidelink relay UE or sidelink remote UE requests E-UTRAN to assign dedicated resources i.e. either contains the unicast destination identity of the sidelink relay UE or of the sidelink remote UE.
commTxResourceReqUC
Indicates the frequency on which the UE is interested to transmit non-relay related one-to-one sidelink communication as well as the sidelink communication transmission destination(s) for which the UE requests E-UTRAN to assign dedicated resources. NOTE 1.
destinationInfoList
Indicates the destination(s) for relay or non-relay related one-to-one or one-to-many sidelink communication. For one-to-one sidelink communication the destination is identified by the ProSe UE ID for unicast communication, while for one-to-many the destination it is identified by the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID as specified in TS 23.303 [68].
discRxInterest
Indicates that the UE is interested to monitor sidelink discovery announcements.
discSysInfoReportFreqList
Indicates, for one or more frequencies, a list of sidelink discovery related parameters acquired from system Information of cells on configured inter-frequency carriers.
discTxResourceReq
Indicates the number of separate discovery message(s) the UE wants to transmit every discovery period. This field concerns the resources the UE requires every discovery period for transmitting sidelink discovery announcement(s).
discTxResourceReqAddFreq
Indicates, for any frequencies in addition to the one covered by discTxResourceReq, the number of separate discovery message(s) the UE wants to transmit every discovery period. This field concerns the resources the UE requires every discovery period for transmitting sidelink discovery announcement(s).
discTxResourceReqPS
Indicates the number of separate PS related discovery message(s) the UE wants to transmit every discovery period. This field concerns the resources the UE requires every discovery period for transmitting PS related sidelink discovery announcement(s).
p2x-CommTxType
Indicates that the requested transmission resource pool is for P2X related V2X sidelink communication.
reliabilityInfoListSL
Indicates the reliability(ies) (i.e., PPPRs as specified in TS 36.300 [9]), associated with the reported traffic to be transmitted for V2X sidelink communication.
v2x-CommRxInterestedFreqList
Indicates the index(es) of the frequency(ies) on which the UE is interested to receive V2X sidelink communication. The value 1 corresponds to the frequency of first entry in v2x-InterFreqInfoList broadcast in SIB21, the value 2 corresponds to the frequency of second entry in v2x-InterFreqInfoList broadcast in SIB21 and so on. If SIB26 is broadcast and the number of entries included in v2x-InterFreqInfoList of SIB21 is N, the value N+1 corresponds to the frequency of the first entry which is included in v2x-InterFreqInfoList broadcast in SIB26 and has a frequency not included in SIB21, the value N+2 corresponds to the frequency of the second entry which is included in v2x-InterFreqInfoList broadcast in SIB26 and has a frequency not included in SIB21, and so on. The value 0 corresponds the PCell's frequency.
v2x-DestinationInfoList
Indicates the destination(s) for V2X sidelink communication.
v2x-TypeTxSync
Indicates the synchronization reference used by the UE.

NOTE 1:	When configuring commTxResourceReq, commTxResourceReqUC, commTxResourceReqRelay and commTxResourceReqRelayUC, E-UTRAN configures at most maxSL-Dest-r12 destinations in total (i.e. as included in the four fields together).

CQI-ReportConfig field descriptions
altCQI-Table, altCQI-Table-1024QAM
Indicates the applicability of the alternative CQI table (i.e. Table 7.2.3-2 and Table 7.2.3-4 in TS 36.213 [23]) for both aperiodic and periodic CSI reporting for the concerned serving cell. Value allSubframes means the alternative CQI table applies to all the subframes and CSI processes, if configured, and value csi-SubframeSet1 means the alternative CQI table applies to CSI subframe set1, and value csi-SubframeSet2 means the alternative CQI table applies to CSI subframe set2. EUTRAN sets the value to csi-SubframeSet1 or csi-SubframeSet2 only if transmissionMode is set in range tm1 to tm9 and csi-SubframePatternConfig-r10 is configured for the concerned serving cell and different CQI tables apply to the two CSI subframe sets; otherwise EUTRAN sets the value to allSubframes. EUTRAN does not configure altCQI-Table-r12 in CQI-ReportConfig-v1250 and altCQI-Table-1024QAM-r15 in CQI-ReportConfig-v1530 or in CQI-ReportConfigSCell-r15 in the same serving cell simultaneously. If altCQI-Table-r12 and altCQI-Table-1024QAM-r15 are absent, the UE shall use Table 7.2.3-1 in TS 36.213 [23] for all subframes and CSI processes, if configured.
cqi-Mask
Limits CQI/PMI/PTI/RI reports to the on-duration period of the DRX cycle, see TS 36.321 [6]. One value applies for all CSI processes and all serving cells (the associated functionality is common i.e. not performed independently for each cell).
cqi-ReportAperiodic
E-UTRAN does not configure CQI-ReportAperiodic when transmission mode 10 is configured for all serving cells. E-UTRAN configures cqi-ReportAperiodic-v1250 only if cqi-ReportAperiodic-r10 and csi-MeasSubframeSets-r12 are configured. E-UTRAN configures cqi-ReportAperiodic-v1310 only if cqi-ReportAperiodic-r10 is configured.
cqi-ReportModeAperiodic
Parameter: reporting mode. Value rm12 corresponds to Mode 1-2, rm20 corresponds to Mode 2-0, rm22 corresponds to Mode 2-2 etc. PUSCH reporting modes are described in TS 36.213 [23], clause 7.2.1. The UE shall ignore cqi-ReportModeAperiodic-r10 when transmission mode 10 is configured for the serving cell on this carrier frequency. The UE shall ignore cqi-ReportModeAperiodic-r10 configured for the PCell/ PSCell when the transmission bandwidth of the PCell/PSCell in downlink is 6 resource blocks.
cqi-ReportPeriodic
E-UTRAN does not configure CQI-ReportPeriodic for sTTI within CQI-ReportConfig.
csi-MeasSubframeSets
Indicates the two CSI subframe sets. Value 0 means the subframe belongs to CSI subframe set 1 and value 1 means the subframe belongs to CSI subframe set 2. CSI subframe set 1 refers to CCSI,0 in TS 36.213 [23], clause 7.2, and CSI subframe set 2 refers to CCSI,1 in TS 36.213 [23], clause 7.2. EUTRAN does not configure csi-MeasSubframeSet1-r10 and csi-MeasSubframeSet2-r10 if either csi-MeasSubframeSets-r12 for PCell or eimta-MainConfigPCell-r12 is configured.
csi-MeasSubframeSet1, csi-MeasSubframeSet2
Indicates the CSI measurement subframe sets. csi-MeasSubframeSet1 refers to CCSI,0 in TS 36.213 [23], clause 7.2 and csi-MeasSubframeSet2 refers to CCSI,1 in TS 36.213 [23], clause 7.2. E-UTRAN only configures the two CSI measurement subframe sets for the PCell.
nomPDSCH-RS-EPRE-Offset
Parameter:  see TS 36.213 [23], clause 7.2.3. Actual value = field value * 2 [dB].

CSI-Process field descriptions
advancedCodebookEnabled
Value TRUE indicates that the UE should use the advanced code book defined in TS 36.213 [23]. EUTRAN does not configure the field when the UE is configured with eMIMO-Type is set to beamformed, when the UE is configured with eMIMO-Hybrid or when the UE is configured with semiOpenLoop.
alternativeCodebookEnabledFor4TXProc
Indicates whether code book in TS 36.213 [23] Table 7.2.4-0A to Table 7.2.4-0D is being used for deriving CSI feedback and reporting for a CSI process. EUTRAN may configure the field only if the number of CSI-RS ports for non-zero power transmission CSI-RS configuration is 4.
cqi-ReportAperiodicProc
If csi-MeasSubframeSets-r12 is configured for the same frequency as the CSI process, cqi-ReportAperiodicProc
applies for CSI subframe set 1. If csi-MeasSubframeSet1-r10 or csi-MeasSubframeSet2-r10 are configured for the same frequency as the CSI process, cqi-ReportAperiodicProc applies for CSI subframe set 1 or CSI subframe set 2. Otherwise, cqi-ReportAperiodicProc applies for all subframes. E-UTRAN configures cqi-ReportAperiodicProc-v1310 only if cqi-ReportAperiodicProc-r11 is configured
cqi-ReportAperiodicProc2
cqi-ReportAperiodicProc2 is configured only if csi-MeasSubframeSets-r12 is configured for the same frequency as the CSI process. cqi-ReportAperiodicProc2 is for CSI subframe set 2. E-UTRAN shall set cqi-ReportModeAperiodic-r11 in cqi-ReportAperiodicProc2 the same as in cqi-ReportAperiodicProc. E-UTRAN configures cqi-ReportAperiodicProc2-v1310 only if cqi-ReportAperiodicProc2-r12 is configured.
cqi-ReportBothProc
Includes CQI configuration parameters applicable for both aperiodic and periodic CSI reporting, for which CSI process specific values may be configured. E-UTRAN configures the field if and only if cqi-ReportPeriodicProcId is included and/ or if cqi-ReportAperiodicProc is included.
cqi-ReportPeriodicProcId
Refers to a periodic CQI reporting configuration that is configured for the same frequency as the CSI process. Value 0 refers to the set of parameters defined by the REL-10 CQI reporting configuration fields, while the other values refer to the additional configurations E-UTRAN assigns by CQI-ReportPeriodicProcExt-r11 (and as covered by CQI-ReportPeriodicProcExtId).
csi-IM-ConfigId
Refers to a CSI-IM configuration that is configured for the same frequency as the CSI process. If csi-IM-ConfigId-v1250 or csi-IM-ConfigId-v1310 is configured, the UE only considers this extension (i.e., UE ignores csi-IM-ConfigId-r11 and csi-IM-ConfigId-r12).
csi-IM-ConfigIdList
 Refers to one or two CSI-IM configurations that are configured for the same frequency as the CSI process. csi-IM-ConfigIdList can include 2 entries only if csi-MeasSubframeSets-r12 is configured for the same frequency as the CSI process. 
csi-RS-ConfigNZPId
Refers to a CSI RS configuration using non-zero power transmission that is configured for the same frequency as the CSI process.
dummy
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
eMIMO-Type
Parameter: eMIMO-Type, see TS 36.213 [23], TS 36.211 [21]. If eMIMO-Type is set to nonPrecoded, the codebooks used for deriving CSI feedback are in TS 36.213 [23], Table 7.2.4-10 to Table 7.2.4-17. Choice values nonPrecoded and beamformed correspond to 'CLASS A' and 'CLASS B' respectively, see TS 36.212 [22] and TS 36.213 [23].
feCOMP-CSI-Enabled
Parameter: FeCoMPCSIEnabled, see TS 36.213 [23], clause 7.1.10. Refers to CSI feedback based on FeCoMP. E-UTRAN only configures the field when the UE is configured with eMIMO-Type-r13 set to beamformed with two NZP CSI-RS resources using the IE CSI-RS-ConfigBeamformed-r13 which contains the two NZP CSI-RS reources configued with csi-RS-ConfigNZPIdListExt-r13.
p-C-AndCBSRList
The UE shall ignore p-C-AndCBSRList-r11 if configured with eMIMO-Type unless it is set to beamformed, alternativeCodebookEnabledBeamformed (in CSI-RS-ConfigBeamformed) is set to FALSE and csi-RS-ConfigNZPIdListExt is not configured,

CSI-RS-ConfigBeamformed field descriptions
ace-For4Tx-PerResourceConfigList
The field indicates the alternativeCodeBookEnabledFor4TX-r12 per CSI-RS resource. E-UTRAN configures the field only if csi-RS-ConfigNZPIdListExt is configured.
activatedResources
The number of activated CSI-RS resources, which concerns a subset of the aperiodic CSI-RS resources (for both semi-persistent and aperiodic mode). E-UTRAN configures at most the minimum between nMaxResource as configured by MIMO-UE-ParametersPerTM-r1430 and the number of resources as configured by csi-RS-ConfigNZP-ApList-r14.
alternativeCodebookEnabledBeamformed
The field indicates whether code book in TS 36.213 [23], Table 7.2.4-18 to Table 7.2.4-20, is being used for deriving CSI feedback and reporting for a CSI process. E-UTRAN configures the field only for a process referring to a single RS configuration using non-zero power transmission (i.e a process for which csi-RS-ConfigNZPIdListExt is not configured). Field alternativeCodebookEnabledBeamformed corresponds to parameter alternativeCodebookEnabledCLASSB_K1 in TS 36.212 [22] and TS 36.213 [23].
csi-IM-ConfigIdList
E-UTRAN configures the field csi-IM-ConfigIdList only if the IE is included in CSI-Process is configured (i.e. when TM10 is configured for the serving cell).
CSI-RS-ConfigBeamformed
If csi-RS-ConfigNZPIdListExt-r13 is configured, E-UTRAN configures the same total number of entries for NZP, csi-IM-ConfigIdList-r13 and p-C-AndCBSR-PerResourceConfigList-r13.
csi-RS-ConfigNZP-ApList
The field is used to configure NZP configurations for aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI RS reporting for which MAC controls activation. EUTRAN configures this field only when the UE is configured to use 2, 4 or and 8 ports CSI-RS, in which case EUTRAN configures the number of entries to be the same as the number of NZP resource configurations. For all these entries the UE shall ignore field subframeConfig. EUTRAN always configures this field together with csi-RS-NZP-Activation. Furthermore, for a given process, E-UTRAN does not simultaneously configure the periodic NZP configuration(s) and NZP CSI RS configurations for aperiodic or semi-persistent reporting.
csi-RS-ConfigNZP-EMIMO
The field is used to configure NZP configurations additional to the one defined by the original NZP configuration as included in CSI-RS-Config/ CSI-Process when using 12 and 16 ports CSI-RS.
csi-RS-ConfigNZPIdListExt (in CSI-RS-ConfigBeamformed)
Indicates the NZP configuration(s)in addition to the original NZP configuration, as defined by csi-RS-Config-r10 (TM9) or csi-RS-ConfigNZPId-r11 (TM10). I.e. extends the size of the NZP configuration list (originally a single entry i.e. list of size 1) using the general principles specified in 5.1.2.
p-C-AndCBSR-PerResourceConfigList
E-UTRAN does not configure the field p-C-AndCBSR-PerResourceConfigList if the UE is configured with eMIMO-Type set to beamformed, alternativeCodebookEnabledBeamformed is set to FALSE and csi-RS-ConfigNZPIdListExt is not configured.

Timer for prohibiting SR transmission on SPUCCH in TS 36.321 [6]. Value in number of SR period(s) of shortest SR period of any serving cell with SPUCCH. Value 0 means that behaviour as specified in 7.3.2 applies. Value 1 corresponds to one SR period, value 2 corresponds to 2 SR periods and so on. SR period is defined in TS 36.213 [23], table 10.1.5-1.

stag-Id
Indicates the TAG of an SCell, see TS 36.321 [6]. Uniquely identifies the TAG within the scope of a Cell Group (i.e. MCG or SCG). If the field is not configured for an SCell (e.g. absent in MAC-MainConfigSCell), the SCell is part of the PTAG.

stag-ToAddModList, stag-ToReleaseList
Used to configure one or more STAGs. E-UTRAN ensures that a STAG contains at least one SCell with configured uplink. If, due to SCell release a reconfiguration would result in an 'empty' TAG, E-UTRAN includes release of the concerned TAG.

timeAlignmentTimerSTAG
Indicates the value of the time alignment timer for an STAG, see TS 36.321 [6].

ttiBundling
TRUE indicates that TTI bundling TS 36.321 [6] is enabled while FALSE indicates that TTI bundling is disabled. TTI bundling can be enabled for FDD and for TDD for configurations 0, 1 and 6 and additionally for configurations 2 and 3 when symPUSCH-UpPTS-r14 is configured. The functionality is performed independently per Cell Group (i.e. MCG or SCG), but E-UTRAN does not configure TTI bundling for the SCG. For a TDD PCell, E-UTRAN does not simultaneously enable TTI bundling and semi-persistent scheduling in this release of specification. Furthermore, for a Cell Group, E-UTRAN does not simultaneously configure TTI bundling and SCells with configured uplink, and E-UTRAN does not simultaneously configure TTI bundling and eIMTA.

statusReportRequired
Indicates whether or not the UE shall send a PDCP Status Report upon re-establishment of the PDCP entity, upon PDCP data recovery, upon uplink data switching during DAPS handover and upon release of the source cell after DAPS handover as specified in TS 36.323 [8]. If the UE supports DAPS handover, for RLC UM radio bearers, the field has the value FALSE if it has not been configured.
ul-DataSplitDRB-ViaSCG
Indicates whether the UE shall send PDCP PDUs via SCG as specified in TS 36.323 [8]. E-UTRAN only configures the field (i.e. indicates value TRUE) for split DRBs. For PDCP duplication, if this field is set to TRUE, the primary RLC entity is SCG RLC entity and the secondary RLC entity is MCG RLC entity. If this field is not configured or set to FALSE, the primary RLC entity is MCG RLC entity and the secondary RLC entity is SCG RLC entity.
ul-DataSplitThreshold
Indicates the threshold value for uplink data split operation specified in TS 36.323 [8]. Value b100 means 100 Bytes, b200 means 200 Bytes and so on. E-UTRAN only configures this field for split DRBs.

tbsIndexAlt
Indicates the applicability of the alternative TBS index for the ITBS 26 and 33 (see TS 36.213 [23], Table 7.1.7.2.1-1), to all subframes scheduled by DCI format 2C or 2D. Value a26 refers to the alternative TBS index ITBS 26A, and value a33 refers to the alternative TBS index ITBS 33A. If this field is not configured, the UE shall use ITBS 26 specified in Table 7.1.7.2.1-1 in TS 36.213 [23] for all subframes instead. If neither this field nor tbsIndexAlt2 configures an alternative TBS index for ITBS 33, the UE shall use ITBS 33 specified in Table 7.1.7.2.1-1 in TS 36.213 [23] for all subframes instead.

tbsIndexAlt2
Indicates the applicability of the alternative TBS index for the ITBS 33 (see TS 36.213 [23], Table 7.1.7.2.1-1) to all subframes. Value b33 refers to the alternative TBS index ITBS 33B. If neither this field nor tbsIndexAlt configures an alternative TBS index for ITBS 33, the UE shall use ITBS 33 specified in Table 7.1.7.2.1-1 in TS 36.213 [23] for all subframes instead.

tbs-IndexAlt3
Indicates the applicability of the alternative TBS index for the ITBS 37 (see TS 36.213 [23], Table 7.1.7.2.1-1) to all subframes. Value a37 refers to the alternative TBS index ITBS 37A.

PhysicalConfigDedicated field descriptions

absenceOfAnyOtherTechnology
Presence of this field indicates absence on a long term basis (e.g. by level of regulation) of any other technology sharing the carrier; absence of this field indicates the potential presence of any other technology sharing the carrier, as specified in TS 37.213 [94]. 

additionalSpectrumEmissionPCell
E-UTRAN does not configure this field in this release of the specification.

antennaInfo
A choice is used to indicate whether the antennaInfo is signalled explicitly or set to the default antenna configuration as specified in clause 9.2.4.

blindSlotSubslotPDSCH-Repetitions
Enables HARQ-less/blind slot or subslot PDSCH repetitions for a UE in a given cell, i.e. back to back slot/subslot PDSCH transmissions for the same transport block. The number of slot/subslot PDSCH transmissions is indicated in the DCI.

blindSubframePDSCH-Repetitions
Enables HARQ-less/blind subframe PDSCH repetitions for a UE in a given cell, i.e. back to back PDSCH transmissions for the same transport block. The number of PDSCH transmissions is indicated in the DCI.

ce-CSI-RS-Feedback
Indicates whether CSI-RS-based CSI feedback is enabled for non-BL UE in CE mode A, see TS 36.213 [23], clause 7.2.2.
ce-Mode
Indicates the CE mode as specified in TS 36.213 [23].

ce-pdsch-pusch-Enhancement-Config
Activation of new numbers of repetitions for PUSCH and modulation restrictions for PDSCH/PUSCH in CE mode A, see TS 36.212 [22] and TS 36.213 [23].

cfi-SlotSubslotNonMBSFN
Indicates the semi-static control format indicator for slot/subslot operation in non-MBSFN subframes.

cfi-SlotSubslotMBSFN
Indicates the semi-static control format indicator for slot/subslot operation in MBSFN subframes.

cfi-SubframeMBSFN
Indicates the semi-static control format indicator for subframe operation in MBSFN subframes.

cfi-SubframeNonMBSFN
Indicates the semi-static control format indicator for subframe operation in non-MBSFN subframes.

cqi-ShortConfigSCell
Indicates whether the CSI (CQI/PMI/RI/PTI/CRI) reporting resource configured by cqi-ShortConfigSCell is available upon receiving the SCell activation command for this SCell. E-UTRAN only configures this field when transmission mode 1-8 is configured for the serving cell on this carrier frequency.

csi-RS-Config
For a serving frequency E-UTRAN does not configure csi-RS-Config (includes zeroTxPowerCSI-RS) when transmission mode 10 is configured for the serving cell on this carrier frequency.

csi-RS-ConfigNZPToAddModList
For a serving frequency E-UTRAN configures one or more CSI-RS-ConfigNZP only when transmission mode 9 or 10 is configured for the serving cell on this carrier frequency. For a serving frequency, EUTRAN configures a maximum number of CSI-RS-ConfigNZP in accordance with transmission mode (including CSI processes), eMIMO (including class) and associated UE capabilities (e.g. k-Max, n-MaxList).

csi-RS-ConfigZP-ApList
The aperiodic ZP CSI-RS for PDSCH rate matching. The field subframeConfig is applicable to semi-persistent CSI RS reporting. In other cases, the UE shall ignore field subframeConfig.

csi-RS-ConfigZPToAddModList
For a serving frequency E-UTRAN configures one or more CSI-RS-ConfigZP only when transmission mode 10 is configured for the serving cell on this carrier frequency.

dl-STTI-Length, ul-STTI-Length
Indicates the DL and UL short TTI lengths. Value slot corresponds to 7 OFDM symbols and value subslot corresponds to 2 or 3 OFDM symbols. E-UTRAN configures the same value for all serving cells sending PUCCH feedback on the same cell. If one SCell is configured with short TTI in the group of cells configured to send PUCCH on the same cell, the cell carrying PUCCH shall be configured with short TTI. E-UTRAN can configure different value of dl-STTI-Length and ul-STTI-Length for serving cells sending PUCCH feedback on different cells. E-UTRAN does not configure the combination {slot,subslot} for {DL,UL}. 

dummy
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.

eimta-MainConfigPCell, eimta-MainConfigSCell
If E-UTRAN configures eimta-MainConfigPCell or eimta-MainConfigSCell for one serving cell in a frequency band, E-UTRAN configures eimta-MainConfigPCell or eimta-MainConfigSCell for all serving cells residing on the frequency band. E-UTRAN configures eimta-MainConfigPCell or eimta-MainConfigSCell only if eimta-MainConfig is configured.

NOTE 1:	During handover, the UE performs a MAC reset, which involves reverting to the default CQI/ SRS/ SR configuration in accordance with clause 5.3.13 and TS 36.321 [6], clauses 5.9 and 5.2. Hence, for these parts of the dedicated radio resource configuration, the default configuration (rather than the configuration used in the source PCell) is used as the basis for the delta signalling that is included in the message used to perform handover.
NOTE 2:	Since delta signalling is not supported for the common SCell configuration, E-UTRAN can only add or release the uplink of an SCell by releasing and adding the concerned SCell.

RadioResourceConfigDedicated field descriptions
crs-ChEstMPDCCH-ConfigDedicated
Indicates whether use of CRS for improving channel estimation on MPDCCH is enabled in RRC_CONNECTED. If this field is not configured, the field crs-ChEstMPDCCH-ConfigCommon in SystemInformationBlockType2 applies, if present.
crs-IntfMitigConfig
crs-IntfMitigEnabled-r15 indicates CRS interference mitigation is enabled for the cell, as specified in TS 36.133 [16], clause 3.6.1.1. For BL UEs supporting ce-CRS-IntfMitig, presence of this field indicates CRS interference mitigation is enabled in the cell, as specified in TS 36.133 [16], clauses 3.6.1.2 and 3.6.1.3, and the value crs-IntfMitigNumPRBs indicates number of PRBs, i.e. 6 or 24 PRBs, for CRS transmission in the central cell BW when CRS interference mitigation is enabled. For UEs not supporting this feature, the behaviour is undefined if this field is configured and the field cellBarred in SystemInformationBlockType1 (SystemInformationBlockType1-BR for BL UEs or UEs in CE) is set to notbarred.
crs-PortsCount
Parameter represents the number of antenna ports for cell-specific reference signal used by the signaled neighboring cell where n1 corresponds to 1 antenna port, n2 to 2 antenna ports etc. see TS 36.211 [21], clause 6.10.1.
daps-HO
This field indicates that the handover, triggered in the same RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, shall be performed as a DAPS HO for the DRB. daps-HO is not configured if sidelink is configured.
drb-Identity
In case of DC, the DRB identity is unique within the scope of the UE i.e. an SCG DRB can not use the same value as used for an MCG or split DRB. For a split DRB the same identity is used for the MCG- and SCG parts of the configuration.
drb-ToAddModList
When drb-ToAddModList-r15 is configured, UE shall ignore the drb-ToAddModList (without suffix).
drb-ToAddModListSCG
When an SCG is configured, E-UTRAN configures at least one SCG or split DRB. When drb-ToAddModListSCG-r15 is configured, UE shall ignore the drb-ToAddModListSCG (without suffix). When NE-DC is configured, this field indicates the SCG RLC bearers to be (re-)configured.
drb-ToReleaseList
When drb-ToReleaseList-r15 is configured, UE shall ignore the drb-ToReleaseList (without suffix).
drb-ToReleaseListSCG
When NE-DC is configured, this field indicates the SCG RLC bearers to be released.
drb-Type
This field indicates whether the DRB is split or SCG DRB. E-UTRAN does not configure split and SCG DRBs simultaneously for the UE.
drb-TypeChange
Indicates that a split/SCG DRB is reconfigured to an MCG DRB (i.e. E-UTRAN only signals the field in case the DRB type changes).
drb-TypeLWA
Indicates whether a DRB is (re)configured as an LWA DRB or an LWA DRB is reconfigured not to use WLAN resources. NOTE 1
drb-TypeLWIP
Indicates whether a DRB is (re)configured to use LWIP Tunnel in UL and DL (value lwip), DL only (value lwip-DL-only), UL only (value lwip-UL-only) or not to use LWIP Tunnel (value eutran).
dummy
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
logicalChannelConfig
For SRBs a choice is used to indicate whether the logical channel configuration is signalled explicitly or set to the default logical channel configuration for SRB1 as specified in 9.2.1.1 or for SRB2 as specified in 9.2.1.2.
logicalChannelIdentity, LogicalChannelIdentityExt
The logical channel identity for both UL and DL. Value 4 is not configured for DRBs if SRB4 is configured. When logicalChannelIdentity-r15 is signalled, UE shall ignore contents of logicalChannelIdentity (without suffix).
logicalChannelIdentitySCG
The logical channel identity for both UL and DL. When logicalChannelIdentitySCG-r15 is signalled, UE shall ignore contents of logicalChannelIdentitySCG (without suffix).
lwa-WLAN-AC
For LWA bearers, indicates the corresponding WLAN access category for uplink. AC-BK (value ac-bk) corresponds to Background access category, AC-BE (value ac-be) corresponds to Best Effort access category, AC-VI (value ac-vi) corresponds to Video access category and AC-VO (value ac-vo) corresponds to Voice access category as defined by IEEE 802.11-2012 [67]. If lwa-WLAN-AC is not configured, it is left up to UE to decide which IEEE 802.11 AC value to use when performing transmissions of packets for this DRB over WLAN in the uplink.
lwip-DL-Aggregation, lwip-UL-Aggregation
Indicates whether LWIP is configured to utilize LWIP aggregation in DL or UL.
mac-MainConfig
Although the ASN.1 includes a choice that is used to indicate whether the mac-MainConfig is signalled explicitly or set to the default MAC main configuration as specified in 9.2.2, EUTRAN does not apply "defaultValue".
mbsfn-SubframeConfig
Defines the MBSFN subframe configuration used by the signaled neighboring cell. If absent, UE assumes no MBSFN configuration for the neighboring cell.
measSubframePatternPCell
Time domain measurement resource restriction pattern for the PCell measurements (RSRP, RSRQ and the radio link monitoring).
neighCellsCRS-Info, neighCellsCRS-InfoSCell, neighCellsCRS-InfoPSCell
This field contains assistance information used by the UE to mitigate interference from CRS while performing RRM/RLM/CSI measurement or data demodulation or DL control channel demodulation. When the received CRS assistance information is for a cell with CRS non-colliding with that of the CRS of the cell to measure, the UE may use the CRS assistance information to mitigate CRS interference. When the received CRS assistance information is for a cell with CRS colliding with that of the CRS of the cell to measure, the UE may use the CRS assistance information to mitigate CRS interference RRM/RLM (as specified in TS 36.133 [16]) and for CSI (as specified in TS 36.101 [42]) on the subframes indicated by measSubframePatternPCell, measSubframePatternConfigNeigh, csi-MeasSubframeSet1 if configured, and the CSI subframe set 1 if csi-MeasSubframeSets-r12 is configured. The UE may use CRS assistance information to mitigate CRS interference from the cells in the CRS-AssistanceInfoList for the demodulation purpose or DL control channel demodulation as specified in TS 36.101 [42]. EUTRAN does not configure neighCellsCRS-Info-r11 or neighCellsCRS-Info-r13 if eimta-MainConfigPCell-r12 is configured.
neighCellsToAddModList
This field contains assistance information used by the UE to cancel and suppress interference of a neighbouring cell. If this field is present for a neighbouring cell, the UE assumes that the transmission parameters listed in the sub-fields are used by the neighbouring cell. If this field is present for a neighbouring cell, the UE assumes the neighbour cell is subframe and SFN synchronized to the serving cell, has the same system bandwidth, UL/DL and special subframe configuration, and cyclic prefix length as the serving cell.
newUE-Identity
C-RNTI used after moving to RRC_CONNECTED in response to transmission using PUR.
p-aList
Indicates the restricted subset of power offset for QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM PDSCH transmissions for the neighbouring cell by using the parameter, see TS 36.213 [23], clause 5.2. Value dB-6 corresponds to -6 dB, dB-4dot77 corresponds to -4.77 dB etc.
p-b
Parameter: , indicates the cell-specific ratio used by the signaled neighboring cell, see TS 36.213 [23], Table 5.2-1.
pdcp-verChange
Indicates that the PDCP version of the SRB is changed from NR PDCP to E-UTRA PDCP. Network only configures this version change for during handover, resume and first reconfiguration after re-establishment. E-UTRAN does not include this field when SRB-ToAddMod is included in srb-ToAddModListSCG.
physicalConfigDedicated
The default dedicated physical configuration is specified in 9.2.4.
resAllocGranularity
Indicates the resource allocation and precoding granularity in PRB pair level of the signaled neighboring cell, see TS 36.213 [23], clause 7.1.6.
rlc-BearerConfigSecondary
The configuration of a secondary RLC bearer within the same Cell Group as may e.g. be used in case of PDCP duplication using CA. The configuration comprises a (secondary) RLC entity, a logical channel identity and a logical channel configuration. E-UTRAN may configure this for SRB1, SRB2 and DRBs. For SRBs, E-UTRAN only configures the field for MCG (i.e. if included in radioResourceConfigDedicated. E-UTRAN configures the same RLC mode (AM/ UM) as used for the original RLC entity. The primary RLC entity is configured by RLC-Config.
rlc-Config
For SRBs a choice is used to indicate whether the RLC configuration is signalled explicitly or set to the values defined in the default RLC configuration for SRB1 in 9.2.1.1 or for SRB2 in 9.2.1.2. RLC AM is the only applicable RLC mode for SRB1 and SRB2. E-UTRAN does not reconfigure the RLC mode of DRBs except when a full configuration option is used, and may reconfigure the RLC SN field size and the AM RLC LI field size only upon handover within E-UTRA or upon the first reconfiguration after RRC connection re-establishment or upon SCG Change for SCG and split DRBs.
servCellp-a
Indicates the power offset for QPSK C-RNTI based PDSCH transmissions used by the serving cell, see TS 36.213 [23], clause 5.2. Value dB-6 corresponds to -6 dB, dB-4dot77 corresponds to -4.77 dB etc.
sps-Config
The default SPS configuration is specified in 9.2.3. Except for handover or releasing SPS for MCG, E-UTRAN does not reconfigure sps-Config for MCG when there is a configured downlink assignment or a configured uplink grant for MCG (see TS 36.321 [6]). Except for SCG change or releasing SPS for SCG, E-UTRAN does not reconfigure sps-Config for SCG when there is a configured downlink assignment or a configured uplink grant for SCG (see TS 36.321 [6]). In one serving cell, sps-Config-v1530 is not present simultaneously with either sps-Config (without suffix) or sps-Config-r12.
srb-Identity
Value 1 is applicable for SRB1 only. Value 2 is applicable for SRB2 only. Value 4 is applicable for SRB4 only, if configured. For a split SRB the same identity is used for the MCG and NR SCG RLC bearer configurations. If srb-Identity-v1530 is received, the UE shall ignore srb-Identity (i.e. without suffix).
srb-Identity-v1530
E-UTRAN does not include this field when SRB-ToAddMod is included in srb-ToAddModListSCG.
srb-ToAddModListExt
The field is to configure SRB4.
srb-ToAddModList
E-UTRAN configures the same RAT type (i.e. EUTRA or NR) for PDCP configuration of SRB1 and SRB2.
transmissionModeList
Indicates a subset of transmission mode 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, for the signaled neighboring cell for which NeighCellsInfo applies. When TM10 is signaled, other signaled transmission parameters in NeighCellsInfo are not applicable to up to 8 layer transmission scheme of TM10. E-UTRAN may indicate TM9 when TM10 with QCL type A and DMRS scrambling with  in TS 36.211 [21], clause 6.10.3.1, is used in the signalled neighbour cell and TM9 or TM10 with QCL type A and DMRS scrambling with  in TS 36.211 [21], clause 6.10.3.1, is used in the serving cell. UE behaviour with NAICS when TM10 is used is only defined when QCL type A and DMRS scrambling with  in TS 36.211 [21], clause 6.10.3.1, is used for the serving cell and all signalled neighbour cells. The first/ leftmost bit is for transmission mode 1, the second bit is for transmission mode 2, and so on.

NOTE 1:	It is up to eNB to ensure that the field indicating LWA bearer type is set to FALSE when LWA bearer is no longer used (e.g. during handover or re-establishment where LWA configuration is released).

ResourceReservationConfig field descriptions
periodicityStartPos
Indicates periodicity and start offset of the reserved resources. Value set to periodicity10ms corresponds to periodicity 10 milliseconds and corresponding start position is 0, value set to periodicity20ms corresponds to periodicity 20 milliseconds and corresponding start position in milliseconds = indicated value * 10ms, and so on.
resourceReservationFreq
Downlink frequency domain resource reservation bitmap where each bit corresponds to a resource block group (RBG), see TS 36.213 [23]. Value rbg-Bitmap1dot4 corresponds to 1.4 MHz system bandwidth, value rbg-Bitmap3 corresponds to 3 MHz system bandwidth, and so on. If the field is absent, all RBGs in the system bandwidth are reserved.
slotBitmap
Slot-level resource reservation configuration. Value slotPattern10ms corresponds to 10ms slot pattern and slotPattern40ms corresponds to 40ms slot pattern, see TS 36.213 [23] for DL and TS 36.211 [21] for UL.
The first/leftmost 2-bits corresponds to the subframe #0 of the radio frame satisfying SFN mod periodicity = start position, as indicated by periopdicityStartPos. Two bits for each subframe coded as:
00: both slots are not reserved
01: the first slot is not reserved, the second slot is reserved
10: the first slot is reserved, the second slot is not reserved
11: both slots are reserved.
For a UE that supports subframe-level resource reservation but does not support slot/symbol-level resource reservation, two bits for each subframe are interpreted as:
00: subframe is not reserved
01: subframe is reserved. E-UTRAN does not set the field to this value when included in dedicated signalling.
10: subframe is reserved. E-UTRAN does not set the field to this value when included in dedicated signalling.
11: subframe is reserved.
If the field is not included in UL configuration, the value of the field from DL configuration applies.
symbolBitmap1, symbolBitmap2
Provides the symbol-level resource reservation for one subframe. If symbolBitmap1 is absent, value '01' in the slotBitmap corresponds to the whole 2nd slot being reserved. If symbolBitmap2 is absent, value '10' in the slotBitmap corresponds to the whole 1st slot being reserved.
A UE that supports subframe-level resource reservation but does not support slot/symbol-level resource reservation shall ignore symbolBitmap1 and symbolBitmap2, if present.

Conditional presence
Explanation
Bitmap1
The field is optionally present, need OR, if value of slotBitmap corresponding to at least one subframe is '01'; otherwise the field is not present.

Bitmap2
The field is optionally present, need OR, if value of slotBitmap corresponding to at least one subframe is '10'; otherwise the field is not present.

FDDandTDDnoDL
The field is mandatory present for TDD when resource reservation for DL is not configured, and for FDD; otherwise the field is optionally present, need OP.

SPDCCH-Config field descriptions
al-StartingPointSPDCCH
Indicates the starting SCCE index for an aggregation level, see TS 36.213 [23], clause 9.1.6.
dci7-Candidates
Number of candidates in each aggregation level for DCI format 7. The number of PDCCH/SPDCCH candidate(s) M_DCI format 7^((L)) at aggregation level L for monitoring DCI format 7 in PDCCH and SPDCCH region shall conform to the following restriction:
•	less than or equal to 2 for aggregation level 4 and 8,
•	less than or equal to 6 for aggregation level 1 and 2
dci7-CandidatesPerAL-SPDCCH
SPDCCH candidates configured per aggregation level in SPDCCH region 
dmrs-ScramblingSeqSPDCCH
The DMRS scrambling sequence initialization parameter defined in TS 36.211 [21], clause 6.10.3A.1.
numberRB-InFreq-domain
Indicates the number of resource-blocks in the frequency domain used for the SPDCCH set. There is no restriction on the number of RBs in the frequency domain that can be configured to an SPDCCH resouce set (up to 100), but at least two need to be configured to contain at least one SCCE. The granularity of resource block allocation in frequency domain for configuring an SPDCCH resource set is one in case spdcch-SetReferenceSig-r15 is set to crs. The granularity of resource block allocation for configuring an SPDCCH resource set is two in case sPDCCH-SetReferenceSig-r15 is set to dmrs.
rateMatchingMode
Indicates, per resource-set, the mode of SPDCCH rate-matching operation
•	Mode 1: UE rate-matches only around the DCI format 7 scheduling the slot or subslot PDSCH (if transmitted in theSPDCCH resouce-set), otherwise no rate-matching is performed for the RB set.
•	Mode 2: UE rate-matches around the whole SPDCCH resource set
•	Mode 3: UE rate-matches around the whole SPDCCH resource set if DCI format 7 scheduling the slot or subslot PDSCH is found in the resource-set, otherwise no rate-matching is performed for the RB set.
•	Mode 4: UE rate-matches around the whole SPDCCH resource set if DCI format 7 scheduling the slot or subslot PDSCH is not found in the resource-set, otherwise UE rate-matches only around the DCI format 7 scheduling the slot or subslot PDSCH (if transmitted in the SPDCCH resource-set)
If the DCI format 7 scheduling the slot or subslot PDSCH is found on a candidate belonging to two SPDCCH resource sets, the DCI format 7 is assumed to be found in both resource sets.
resourceBlockAssignment
Indicates the index to a specific combination of physical resource block in frequency for SPDCCH set, see TS 36.213 [23], clause 9.1.4.4. The value range is dependent on the combinatorial number defined in 36.213 [23], clause 9.1.4.4 with the assumption of no limitation in the number of RBs in frequency domain configured by the set. 
spdcch-NoOfSymbols
Indicates the number of OFDM symbols that the CRS based SPDCCH is mapped over.
spdcch-L1-ReuseIndication
For the up to two resource sets configured with the same subframeType applicability, the SPDCCH-L1-ReuseIndication defines the allowed combinations for the two resource sets: {1,1}, {2,0} or {0,2} corresponding to the values n0, n1 and n2 repsectively. In case one resource set is configured, the allowed combinations are {2, 0} or {0,2} corresponding to n1 or n2. EUTRAN does not configure n0 in case one resource set is configured.
spdcch-SetConfigId
Indicates the ID of the SPDCCH set configured in SPDCCH-Elements. Maximum two sets can be configured for MBSFN and two for non-MBSFN. 
spdcch-SetReferenceSig
Indicates CRS or DMRS based SPDCCH set.
subframeType
Indicates applicable subframe type(s) for the SPDCCH set. CRS-based SPDCCH is only applied to non-MBSFN subframe.
subslotApplicability
Indicates the set of subslots within the subframe where SPDCCH candidate set per aggregation levels applies, see DCI7-CandidateSetsPerAL-SPDCCH. The bitmap applies to the 5 DL subslot indices in a DL subframe. The first element in the sequence DCI7-CandidateSetsPerAL-SPDCCH applies to the indicated subslotApplicability. The second element in the sequence (if present) applies to the complement of the subslotApplicability.
transmissionType
Indicates whether distributed or localized SPDCCH transmission mode is used as defined in TS 36.211 [21], clause 6.8A.1.

time, timeInfoType
This field indicates time reference with 0.25 us granularity. The indicated time is referenced at the network, i.e., without compensating for RF propagation delay. The indicated time in 0.25 us unit from the origin is refDays*86400*1000*4000 + refSeconds*1000*4000 + refMilliSeconds*4000 + refQuarterMicroSeconds. The refDays field specifies the sequential number of days (with day count starting at 0) from the origin of the time field. If timeInfoType is not included, the origin of the time field is 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 6 January, 1980 (start of GPS time). If timeInfoType is set to localClock, the interpretation of the origin of the time is unspecified and left up to upper layers.
If time field is included in SystemInformationBlockType16, this field is excluded when estimating changes in system information, i.e. changes of time should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of systemInfoValueTag in SIB1.

NOTE 1:	The IE UE-EUTRA-Capability does not include AS security capability information, since these are the same as the security capabilities that are signalled by NAS. Consequently, AS need not provide "man-in-the-middle" protection for the security capabilities.
NOTE 2:	The column FDD/ TDD diff indicates if the UE is allowed to signal, as part of the additional capabilities for an XDD mode i.e. within UE-EUTRA-CapabilityAddXDD-Mode-xNM, a different value compared to the value signalled elsewhere within UE-EUTRA-Capability (i.e. the common value, supported for both XDD modes). A '-' is used to indicate that it is not possible to signal different values (used for fields for which the field description is provided for other reasons). Annex E specifies for which TDD and FDD serving cells a UE supporting TDD/FDD CA shall support a capability for which it indicates support within the capability signalling.
NOTE 2a:	From REL-15 onwards, the UE is not allowed to signal different values for FDD and TDD unless yes is indicated in column FDD/ TDD diff (i.e. no need to introduce field description solely for the purpose of indicate no).
NOTE 3:	The BandCombinationParameters for the same band combination can be included more than once.
NOTE 4:	UE CA and measurement capabilities indicate the combinations of frequencies that can be configured as serving frequencies.
NOTE 5:	The grouping of the cells to the first and second cell group, as indicated by supportedCellGrouping, is shown in the table below. The leading / leftmost bit of supportedCellGrouping corresponds to the Bit String Position 1.

NOTE 6:	UE includes the intraBandContiguousCC-InfoList-r12 also for bandwidth class A because of the presence conditions in BandCombinationParameters-v1270. For example, if UE supports CA_1A_41D band combination, if UE includes the field intraBandContiguousCC-InfoList-r12 for band 41, the UE includes intraBandContiguousCC-InfoList-r12 also for band 1.
NOTE 6a:	For multiple BandParameters entries with the same bandEUTRA and same ca-BandwidthClassDL in a supported band combination, the UE capabilities indicated by BandParameters are agnostic to the order in which they are indicated in the bandParameterList, under the condition that the set of the capabilities indicated for the concerned bandEUTRA (e.g. bandParametersDL and bandParametersUL) are used together, and the concerned BandParameters correspond to the supportedBandwithCombinationSet for which set of channel bandwidths for carrier(s) is the same among sub-blocks, as defined in TS 36.101 [42], Table 5.6A.1-3, Table 5.6A.1-4, Table 5.6A.1-5.
NOTE 7:	For a UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease but supports a feature specified in release X+ N (i.e. early UE implementation), the ASN.1 comprehension requirement are specified in Annex F.
NOTE 8:	For a UE that does not include mimo-WeightedLayersCapabilities-r13, or for the case with no CC configured with FD-MIMO, the FD-MIMO processing capability condition is not applicable (i.e. considered as satisfied). For a UE that includes mimo-WeightedLayersCapabilities-r13, the FD-MIMO processing capability condition is satisfied if the equation 4.3.28.13-1 in TS 36.306 [5] is satisfied.

MBSFN-AreaInfoList field descriptions
mcch-ModificationPeriod
Defines periodically appearing boundaries, i.e. radio frames for which SFN mod mcch-ModificationPeriod = 0. The contents of different transmissions of MCCH information can only be different if there is at least one such boundary in-between them. In case mcch-ModificationPeriod-v1430 is configured, the UE shall ignore the mcch-ModificationPeriod-r9.
mcch-Offset
Indicates, together with the mcch-RepetitionPeriod, the radio frames in which MCCH is scheduled i.e. MCCH is scheduled in radio frames for which: SFN mod mcch-RepetitionPeriod = mcch-Offset.
mcch-RepetitionPeriod
Defines the interval between transmissions of MCCH information, in radio frames, Value rf32 corresponds to 32 radio frames, rf64 corresponds to 64 radio frames and so on. In case mcch-RepetitionPeriod-v1430 is configured, the UE shall ignore the mcch-RepetitionPeriod-r9.
non-MBSFNregionLength
Indicates how many symbols from the beginning of the subframe constitute the non-MBSFN region. This value applies in all subframes of the MBSFN area used for PMCH transmissions as indicated in the MSI. The values s1 and s2 correspond with 1 and 2 symbols, respectively: see TS 36.211 [21], Table 6.7-1.
notificationIndicator
Indicates which PDCCH bit is used to notify the UE about change of the MCCH applicable for this MBSFN area. Value 0 corresponds with the least significant bit as defined in TS 36.212 [22], clause 5.3.3.1 and so on.
sf-AllocInfo-r9
Indicates the subframes of the radio frames indicated by the mcch-RepetitionPeriod and the mcch-Offset, that may carry MCCH. Value "1" indicates that the corresponding subframe is allocated. If the bitmap is set to all zeros, the corresponding MBSFN area is considered as not configured.
The following mapping applies:
FDD: The first/ leftmost bit defines the allocation for subframe #1 of the radio frame indicated by mcch-RepetitionPeriod and mcch-Offset, the second bit for #2, the third bit for #3, the fourth bit for #6, the fifth bit for #7 and the sixth bit for #8.
TDD: The first/leftmost bit defines the allocation for subframe #3 of the radio frame indicated by mcch-RepetitionPeriod and mcch-Offset, the second bit for #4, third bit for #7, fourth bit for #8, fifth bit for #9. Uplink subframes are not allocated. The last bit is not used.
sf-AllocInfo-r16
Indicates the subframes of the radio frames indicated by the mcch-RepetitionPeriod and the mcch-Offset, that may carry MCCH. Value "1" indicates that the corresponding subframe is allocated. The first/ leftmost bit defines the allocation for subframe #0 of the radio frame indicated by mcch-RepetitionPeriod and mcch-Offset, the second bit for #1 and so on. When subcarrierSpacingMBMS indicates 0.37 kHz subcarrier spacing, a valid MBMS slot can carry MCCH if any subframe corresponding to the slot is configured to carry MCCH.
signallingMCS
Indicates the MCS applicable for the subframes indicated by the field sf-AllocInfo and for each (P)MCH that is configured for this MBSFN area, for the first subframe allocated to the (P)MCH within each MCH scheduling period (which may contain the MCH scheduling information provided by MAC). Value n2 corresponds with the value 2 for parameter in TS 36.213 [23], Table 7.1.7.1-1, and so on.
subcarrierSpacingMBMS
The value indicates subcarrier spacing for MBSFN subframes, kHz7dot5 refers to 7.5 kHz subcarrier spacing, kHz2dot5 refers to 2.5 kHz subcarrier spacing and so on as defined in TS 36.211 [21], clause 6.12. These subframes do not have non-MBSFN region. If subcarrierSpacingMBMS-r14 is present, then non-MBSFNregionLength shall be ignored. EUTRAN configures parameter subcarrierSpacingMBMS only when the MBSFN subframes have subcarrier spacing other than 15 kHz. If subcarrierSpacingMBMS indicates 0.37 kHz subcarrier spacing, the slot as defined in TS 36.211 [21], clause 4.1 is valid only when all the corresponding subframes are configured as MBSFN subframes in this slot.
timeSeparation
Indicates the staggering length for MBSFN-RS associated with PMCH as defined in TS 36.211 [21], clause 6.10.2.2.4. Value sl2 refers to staggering length of 2 slots (MBSFN reference signal pattern type 2) and sl4 refers to staggering length of 4 slots (MBSFN reference signal pattern type 1). E-UTRAN always configures this field when subcarrierSpacingMBMS indicates 0.37 kHz subcarrier spacing. Othewise the field is not configured.

"1" denotes that the corresponding subframe is allocated for MBSFN. The following mapping applies:
FDD: The first/leftmost bit indicated by oneFrame-v1430 defines the MBSFN allocation for subframe #4 and the second bit for #9. The first/leftmost bit indicated by oneFrame-v1610, if present, defines the MBSFN allocation for subframe #0 and the second bit for #5.
radioFrameAllocationPeriod, radioFrameAllocationOffset
Radio-frames that contain MBSFN subframes occur when equation SFN mod radioFrameAllocationPeriod = radioFrameAllocationOffset is satisfied. Value n1 for radioframeAllocationPeriod denotes value 1, n2 denotes value 2, and so on. When fourFrames is used for subframeAllocation, the equation defines the first radio frame referred to in the description below. Values n1 and n2 are not applicable when fourFrames is used.
subframeAllocation
Defines the subframes that are allocated for MBSFN within the radio frame allocation period defined by the radioFrameAllocationPeriod and the radioFrameAllocationOffset.

PMCH-InfoList field descriptions
dataMCS
Indicates the value for parameter in TS 36.213 [23], which defines the MCS applicable for the subframes of this (P)MCH as indicated by the field commonSF-Alloc. Value normal corresponds to Table 7.1.7.1-1 and value higherOrder corresponds to Table 7.1.7.1-1A. The MCS does however neither apply to the subframes that may carry MCCH i.e. the subframes indicated by the field sf-AllocInfo within SystemInformationBlockType13 nor for the first subframe allocated to this (P)MCH within each MCH scheduling period (which may contain the MCH scheduling information provided by MAC).
mch-SchedulingPeriod
Indicates the MCH scheduling period i.e. the periodicity used for providing MCH scheduling information at lower layers (MAC) applicable for an MCH. Value rf8 corresponds to 8 radio frames, rf16 corresponds to 16 radio frames and so on. The mch-SchedulingPeriod starts in the radio frames for which: SFN mod mch-SchedulingPeriod = 0. E-UTRAN configures mch-SchedulingPeriod of the (P)MCH listed first in PMCH-InfoList to be smaller than or equal to mcch-RepetitionPeriod. In case mch-SchedulingPeriod-v1430 is configured, the UE shall ignore mch-SchedulingPeriod-r12.
plmn-Index
Index of the entry across the plmn-IdentityList fields within SystemInformationBlockType1.
sessionId
Indicates the optional MBMS Session Identity, which together with TMGI identifies a transmission or a possible retransmission of a specific MBMS session: see TS 29.061 [51], clauses 20.5, 17.7.11, and 17.7.15. The field is included whenever upper layers have assigned a session identity i.e. one is available for the MBMS session in E-UTRAN.
serviceId
Uniquely identifies the identity of an MBMS service within a PLMN. The field contains octet 3- 5 of the IE Temporary Mobile Group Identity (TMGI) as defined in TS 24.008 [49]. The first octet contains the third octet of the TMGI, the second octet contains the fourth octet of the TMGI and so on.
sf-AllocEnd
Indicates the last subframe allocated to this (P)MCH within a period identified by field commonSF-AllocPeriod. The subframes allocated to (P)MCH corresponding with the nth entry in pmch-InfoList are the subsequent subframes starting from either the next subframe after the subframe identified by sf-AllocEnd of the (n-1)th listed (P)MCH or, for n=1, the first subframe defined by field commonSF-Alloc, through the subframe identified by sf-AllocEnd of the nth listed (P)MCH. Value 0 corresponds with the first subframe defined by field commonSF-Alloc.

SL-DiscResourcePool field descriptions
discPeriod
Indicates the period over which resources are allocated in a cell for discovery message transmission/reception, see PSDCH period in TS 36.213 [23]. Value in number of radio frames. Value rf32 corresponds to 32 radio frames, rf64 corresponds to 64 radio frames and so on. The extended values apply for PS discovery (not only for sidelink relaying). When broadcasting an extended value, E-UTRAN sets the original field to spare to ensure legacy UEs ignore the concerned pool entry.
numRepetition
Indicates the number of times subframeBitmap is repeated for mapping to subframes that occurs within a discPeriod. The highest value E-UTRAN uses is value 5 for FDD and TDD configuration 0, value 13 for TDD configuration 1, value 25 for TDD configuration 2, value 17 for TDD configuration 3, value 25 for TDD configuration 4, value 50 for TDD configuration 5 and value 7 for TDD configuration 6. E-UTRAN configures numRepetition and subframeBitmap such that the mapped subframes do not exceed the discPeriod.
poolSelection
Indicates the mechanism for selecting a (transmission) pool when multiple candidates are provided. E-UTRAN configures the same value (i.e. a pool selection method) for all candidate pools within one pool list (discTxPoolCommon or discTxPoolDedicated) but the pool selection method in different pool lists may or may not be the same.
syncConfigIndex
Indicates the synchronisation configuration that is associated with a reception or transmission pool, by means of an index to the corresponding entry of discSyncConfig in SystemInformationBlockType19.
threshLow, threshHigh
Specifies the thresholds used to select a resource pool in RSRP based pool selection. The E-UTRAN should configure threshLow and threshHigh such that the UE selects only one resource pool upon RSRP based pool selection.

SL-SyncConfig field descriptions
discSyncWindow
Indicates the synchronization window over which the UE expects that SLSS or discovery resources indicated by the pool configuration (see TS 36.213 [23], clause 14.4). The value w1 denotes 5 milliseconds. The value w2 denotes the length corresponding to normal cyclic prefix divided by 2.
gnss-Sync
if configured, the synchronization configuration is used for SLSS transmission/reception when the UE is synchronized to GNSS, by using slssid=0 and ignoring slssid-r12 configured. If not configured, the synchronization configuration is used for SLSS transmission/reception when the UE is synchronized to eNB, by using the configured slssid-r12.
slss-TxDisabled
Value TRUE indicates that the carrier, even though equipped with synchronisation resources, cannot be used as a synchronisation carrier frequency to transmit SLSS or PSBCH.
This parameter cannot be included in SystemInformationBlockType21 or SystemInformationBlockType26.
syncCP-Len
In case of V2X sidelink communications this field is always configured to normal.
syncInfoReserved
Reserved for future use.
syncOffsetIndicator
E-UTRAN should ensure syncOffsetIndicator is set to the same value as syncOffsetIndicator1 or syncOffsetIndicator2 in preconfigSync within SL-Preconfiguration, if configured. If syncOffsetIndicator-v1430 is configured, the UE shall ignore the field syncOffsetIndicator-r12. E-UTRAN should ensure syncOffsetIndicator is set to the same value as syncOffsetIndicator1 in v2x-CommPreconfigSync within SL-V2X-Preconfiguration, if configured. E-UTRAN should ensure syncOffsetIndicator2 is set to the same value as syncOffsetIndicator2 in v2x-CommPreconfigSync within SL-V2X-Preconfiguration, if configured. E-UTRAN should ensure syncOffsetIndicator3 is set to the same value as syncOffsetIndicator3 in v2x-CommPreconfigSync within SL-V2X-Preconfiguration, if configured. E-UTRAN should ensure all values in syncOffsetIndicator are same across all carrier frequencies configured for UEs performing V2X sidelink communication on multiple carrier frequencies. For SL-V2X-Preconfiguration, all values in syncOffsetIndicator should be same across all carrier frequencies configured for UEs performing V2X sidelink communication on multiple carrier frequencies.
syncTxPeriodic
Indicates whether in each discovery period in which UE transmits discovery, the UE transmits SLSS once or periodically (i.e. every 40ms). In the latter case (periodic) the UE also transmits the MasterInformationBlock-SL message alongside. E-UTRAN configures this field only for synchronisation configurations applicable for PS discovery.
syncTxThreshIC
Indicates the threshold used while in coverage. In case the RSRP measurement of the cell chosen for transmission of sidelink communication/ discovery announcements/ V2X sidelink communication, or of the cell used as reference for DL measurements and synchronization, is below the level indicated by this field, the UE may transmit SLSS (i.e. become synchronisation reference) when performing the corresponding sidelink transmission..
txParameters
Includes parameters relevant only for transmission. E-UTRAN includes the field in one entry per list, as included in commSyncConfig or discSyncConfig.

MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB field descriptions
ab-Enabled
Value TRUE indicates that access barring is enabled for UEs connected to EPC.
ab-Enabled-5GC
Value TRUE indicates that access barring is enabled for UEs connected to 5GC.
eutra-Bandwidth
EUTRA system bandwidth. Value bw5or10 corresponds to bandwidth 5 or 10 MHz, value bw15or20 corresponds to bandwidth 15 or 20 MHz.
If the value of eutra-Bandwidth is bw5or10 and rasterOffset is set to khz7dot5 or khz-7dot5, the E-UTRA system bandwidth is 5 MHz.
If the value of eutra-Bandwidth is bw5or10 and rasterOffset is set to khz2dot5 or khz-2dot5, the E-UTRA system bandwidth is 10 MHz.
If the value of eutra-Bandwidth is bw15or20 and rasterOffset is set to khz7dot5 or khz-7dot5, the E-UTRA system bandwidth is 15 MHz.
If the value of eutra-Bandwidth is bw15or20 and rasterOffset is set to khz2dot5 or khz-2dot5, the E-UTRA system bandwidth is 20 MHz.
When the E-UTRA system bandwidth is 5 MHz or 15 MHz, if the value of sib-GuardbandInfo is sib-GuardbandInbandSamePCI or sib-GuardbandinbandDiffPCI, the offset between the anchor carrier and the non-anchor carrier used for SIB1 and/or SI transmission is 45 kHz.
eutra-CRS-SequenceInfo
Information of the carrier containing NPSS/NSSS/NPBCH.
Each value is associated with an E-UTRA PRB index as an offset from the middle of the LTE system sorted out by channel raster offset. See TS 36.211 [21] and TS 36.213 [23].
eutra-NumCRS-Ports, sib-eutra-NumCRS-Ports
Number of E-UTRA CRS antenna ports, either the same number of ports as NRS or 4 antenna ports. See TS 36.211 [21], TS 36.212 [22], and TS 36.213 [23].
hyperSFN-LSB
Indicates the 2 least significant bits of hyper SFN. The remaining bits are present in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB.

If sib1-CarrierInfo is set to non-anchor, E-UTRAN configures a value between 0 and 7. 
sib-GuardbandGuardbandLocation
Location of the non-anchor carrier used for SIB1 and/or SI transmission when operationmodeInfo is set to guardband and the non-anchor carrier is in guardband. See TS 36.213 [23].
Value same corresponds to the carrier adjacent to the anchor carrier on the outer side of the guardband, value opposite corresponds to the carrier closest to the edge of the LTE carrier in the opposite guardband.
sib-GuardbandInfo
Information of the carrier used for SIB1 and/or SI transmission when operationmodeInfo is set to guardband. See TS 36.213 [23].
sib-GuardbandAnchor indicates the anchor carrier.

Location of the non-anchor carrier used for SIB1 and/or SI transmission when operationmodeInfo is set to inband-SamePCI or inband-DifferentPCI, and sib1-CarrierInfo value and/or tdd-SI-CarrierInfo in SIB1-NB is set to non-anchor. See TS 36.213 [23].
Value lower corresponds to the lower adjacent carrier relative to the anchor carrier and value higher corresponds to the higher adjacent carrier relative to the anchor carrier.
If both sib1-CarrierInfo value and tdd-SI-CarrierInfo value in SIB1-NB are set to anchor, the UE ignores sib-InbandLocation.
sib-StandaloneLocation
Location of the non-anchor carrier used for SIB1 and/or SI transmission when operationmodeInfo is set to standalone, and sib1-CarrierInfo value and/or tdd-SI-CarrierInfo in SIB1-NB is set to non-anchor. See TS 36.213 [23].
Value lower corresponds to the lower adjacent carrier relative to the anchor carrier and value higher corresponds to the higher adjacent carrier relative to the anchor carrier.
If both sib1-CarrierInfo value and tdd-SI-CarrierInfo value in SIB1-NB are set to anchor, the UE ignores sib-StandaloneLocation.

SystemInformationBlockType22-NB field descriptions
dl-CarrierConfig
For FDD: Provides the configuration of the DL non-anchor carrier.
For TDD: Provides the configuration of the non-anchor carrier.
dl-ConfigList, dl-ConfigListMixed
For FDD: List of DL non-anchor carriers and associated configuration that can be used for paging and/or random access. E-UTRAN configures DL non-anchor carriers operating in mixed operation mode only in dl-ConfigListMixed and only a UE that supports mixed operation mode uses the carriers in dl-ConfigListMixed. A given carrier is either signalled in the dl-ConfigList or in dl-ConfigListMixed.
If dl-ConfigListMixed is present and at least one of the carriers in dl-ConfigListMixed is configured for paging:
-	If pagingDistribution is present, the UE supporting mixed operation mode creates a combined list of DL carriers for paging by appending dl-ConfigListMixed to the dl-ConfigList while maintaining the order among dl-ConfigList and dl-ConfigListMixed; the total number of signalled DL non-anchor carriers cannot be more than maxNonAnchorCarriers-NB-r14.
-	If pagingDistribution is absent, the UE supporting mixed operation mode uses the list of DL carriers for paging provided in dl-ConfigListMixed and considers pagingWeightAnchor being set to w0, i.e. the anchor carrier is not used.
Otherwise, the pagingDistribution field is not applicable and the UE shall ignore the value.
For TDD: List of non-anchor carriers and associated configuration that can be used for paging and/or random access.
gwus-Config
For FDD: Carrier specific GWUS Configuration.
If both gwus-Config and wus-Config are present for the carrier, E-UTRAN configures the same value for both fields.
mixedOperationModeConfig
For FDD: Provides the configuration of DL and UL non-anchor carriers that can be used for paging and random access by a UE that supports mixed operation mode.
For TDD: This parameter is absent.
npdcch-NumRepetitionPaging
Maximum number of repetitions for NPDCCH common search space (CSS) for paging, see TS 36.213 [23], clause 16.6.
If the field is absent, the value of npdcch-NumRepetitionPaging configured in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB in IE pcch-Config applies.
nprach-Distribution
Indicates which UL carriers a UE supporting mixed operation mode uses for random access as defined in description of ul-ConfigList, ul-ConfigListMixed. 
nprach-ParametersList, nprach-ParametersList-EDT
Configure NPRACH parameters for each NPRACH resource on one non-anchor UL carrier. Up to three NPRACH resources can be configured on one non-anchor UL carrier. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a different number of NPRACH repetitions.
NPRACH resources in nprach-ParametersListEDT are used to initiate EDT. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a maximum TBS signalled in the corresponding entry of edt-TBS-InfoList in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB.
E-UTRAN includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in nprach-ParametersList in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB.
nprach-ParametersListTDD
For TDD: Configure NPRACH parameters for each NPRACH resource on one non-anchor UL carrier. Up to three NPRACH resources can be configured on one non-anchor UL carrier. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a different number of NPRACH repetitions.
E-UTRAN includes the same number of entries in nprach-ParametersListTDD, and listed in the same order, as in nprach-ParametersListTDD in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB..
nprach-ProbabilityAnchor
Configure the selection probability for the anchor carrier NPRACH resource, see TS 36.321 [6]. Value zero corresponds to a probability of 0, oneSixteenth corresponds to the probability of 1/16, oneFifteenth corresponds to the probability of 1/15, and so on.
If the field is absent, the selection probability of the anchor carrier NPRACH resource is 1.
All non-anchor carriers NPRACH resources have equal probability between them.
If there is no NPRACH resource defined on the anchor carrier for one repetition level in nprach-ParametersList-EDT, (respectively nprach-ParametersListFmt2, nprach-ParametersListFmt2-EDT), the UE shall use the value 'zero' and ignore the signalled value of nprach-ProbabilityAnchor for this repetition level for the NPRACH resources defined by nprach-ParametersList-EDT (respectively nprach-ParametersListFmt2, nprach-ParametersListFmt2-EDT).
nprach-ProbabilityAnchorList
Configures the selection probability for each NPRACH resource on the anchor carrier.
E-UTRAN includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in nprach-ParametersList in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB.
pagingDistribution
Indicates which DL carriers a UE supporting mixed operation mode monitors for paging as defined in description of dl-ConfigList, dl-ConfigListMixed.
pagingWeight
Weight of the non-anchor paging carrier for uneven paging load distribution across the carriers. Value w1 corresponds to a relative weight of 1, w2 corresponds to a relative weight of 2, and so on.
The paging load for a carrier 'i' is equal to w(i)/W where i is equal to 0 for the anchor carrier and equal to the index of the carrier in the dl-ConfigList / dl-ConfigListMixed for a non-anchor carrier, W is the sum of the weights of all paging carriers.
To avoid correlation between paging carrier and paging occasion, the weights should be assigned such that: nB * W <= 16384.
pagingWeightAnchor
Weight of the anchor carrier for uneven paging load distribution across the carriers. Value w1 corresponds to a relative weight of 1, w2 corresponds to a relative weight of 2, and so on.
If the field is absent, the (default) value of w0 is applied, i.e. the anchor carrier is not used for paging.
pcch-Config
Configure the PCCH parameters for the non-anchor DL carrier.
tdd-UL-DL-AlignmentOffset
Indicates the offset between the UL carrier frequency center with respect to DL carrier frequency center for the non-anchor carrier.
ul-CarrierFreq
For FDD: UL carrier frequency of the non-anchor carrier as defined in TS 36.101 [42], clause 5.7.3F.
For TDD: This field is absent and the uplink carrier frequency is same as the downlink frequency.
ul-ConfigList, ul-ConfigListMixed
For FDD: List of UL non-anchor carriers and associated configuration that can be used for random access. E-UTRAN configures UL non-anchor carriers operating in mixed operation mode only in ul-ConfigListMixed and only a UE that supports mixed operation mode uses the carriers in ul-ConfigListMixed. A given carrier is either signalled in the ul-ConfigList or in ul-ConfigListMixed.
If ul-ConfigListMixed is present and at least one of the carriers in ul-ConfigListMixed is configured for random access:
-	If nprach-Distribution is present, the UE supporting mixed operation mode creates a combined list of UL carriers for random access by appending ul-ConfigListMixed to the ul-ConfigList while maintaining the order among both ul-ConfigList and ul-ConfigListMixed; the total number of signalled UL non-anchor carriers cannot be more than maxNonAnchorCarriers-NB-r14.
-	If nprach-Distribution is absent, the UE supporting mixed operation mode uses the list of UL carriers for random access provided in ul-ConfigListMixed and considers nprach-ProbabiliyAnchor being set to zero for each NPRACH resource, i.e. the anchor carrier is not used for random access.
Otherwise, the nprach-Distribution field is not applicable and the UE shall ignore the value.
For TDD: E-UTRAN configures ul-ConfigList-r15 and includes the same number of entries as in dl-ConfigList. The UL carrier frequency of the non-anchor carrier is same as the DL carrier frequency.
wus-Config
For FDD: Carrier specific WUS Configuration.

nprach-ParametersListFmt2, nprach-ParametersListFmt2EDT
Configures NPRACH parameters for each NPRACH resource format 2 on one UL carrier. Up to three NPRACH resources can be configured on one carrier. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a different number of NPRACH repetitions.
E-UTRAN includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in nprach-ParametersList in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB.
The NPRACH resources in nprach-ParametersListFmt2EDT are used to initiate EDT. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a TBS signalled in the corresponding entry of edt-TBS-InfoList.
E-UTRAN configures the NPRACH resources format 2 so that they do not overlap in time domain with the NPRACH resources configured in nprach-ParametersList and nprach-ParametersListEDT on the same UL carrier.
If there is no NPRACH resource in nprach-ParametersListFmt2 (respectively nprach-ParametersListFmt2EDT) on any UL carrier, including the anchor carrier, for one NPRACH repetition level, the UE uses the NPRACH resources in nprach-ParametersList (respectively nprach-ParametersListEDT) for this NPRACH repetition level. Otherwise, the UE uses only NPRACH resources in nprach-ParametersListFmt2 (respectively nprach-ParametersListFmt2EDT).
If E-UTRAN configures NPRACH resources format 2 in one NPRACH repetition level, the E-UTRAN configures NPRACH resources format 2 in all NPRACH repetition levels upwards.

NPRACH-ConfigSIB-NB field descriptions
dummy
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
edt-SmallTBS-Enabled
Value TRUE indicates UE performing EDT is allowed to select TBS smaller than edt-TBS for Msg3 according to the corresponding NPRACH resource, as specified in TS 36.213 [23].
edt-SmallTBS-Subset
Presence indicates only two of the TBS values can be used according to edt-TBS corresponding to the NPRACH resource, as specified in TS 36.213 [23]. When the field is not present, any of the TBS values according to edt-TBS corresponding to the NPRACH resource can be used. This field is applicable for a NPRACH resource only when edt-SmallTBS-Enabled is included for the corresponding NPRACH resource.
edt-TBS
Largest TBS for Msg3 for a NPRACH resource applicable to a UE performing EDT. Value in bits. Value b328 corresponds to 328 bits, value b408 corresponds to 408 bits and so on. See TS 36.213 [23].
maxNumPreambleAttemptCE
Maximum number of preamble transmission attempts per NPRACH resource. See TS 36.321 [6].
If the UE supports enhanced random access power control and maxNumPreambleAttemptCE-r14 is included, the UE shall use maxNumPreambleAttemptCE-r14 instead of maxNumPreambleAttemptCE-r13 for the first entry in nprach-ParametersList.
maxNumPreambleAttemptCE-r13 applies to FDD and maxNumPreambleAttemptCE-v1550 applies to TDD.
npdcch-CarrierIndex
For FDD: Index of the carrier in the list of DL non anchor carriers. The first entry in the list has index '1', the second entry has index '2' and so on.
If the UE supports mixed operation mode and dl-ConfigListMixed is present in systemInformationBlockType22-NB,  the UE creates a combined list of DL carriers for random access by appending dl-ConfigListMixed to the dl-ConfigList while maintaining the order among both dl-ConfigList and dl-ConfigListMixed; only the first maxNonAnchorCarriers-NB-r14 DL non-anchor carriers in the concatenated list can be used for random access.
If the field is absent in the entry in nprach-ParametersListEDT in SystemInformationBlockType22-NB, the value of npdcch-CarrierIndex in the corresponding entry of nprach-ParametersList applies, if present. If the field is absent in an entry in nprach-ParametersListFmt2EDT in SystemInformationBlockType23-NB, the value of npdcch-CarrierIndex in the corresponding entry of nprach-ParametersListFmt2 applies, if present. Otherwise, the DL anchor carrier is used.
For TDD: This parameter is absent and the same carrier is used in uplink and downlink.
npdcch-NumRepetitions-RA
Maximum number of repetitions for NPDCCH common search space (CSS) for RAR, Msg3 retransmission and Msg4, see TS 36.213 [23], clause 16.6.
See NOTE.
npdcch-Offset-RA
Fractional period offset of starting subframe for NPDCCH common search space (CSS Type 2), see TS 36.213 [23], clause 16.6.
See NOTE.
npdcch-StartSF-CSS-RA
Starting subframe configuration for NPDCCH common search space (CSS), including RAR, Msg3 retransmission, and Msg4, see TS 36.213 [23], clause 16.6.
See NOTE.
nprach-CP-Length
Cyclic prefix length for NPRACH transmission (TCP), see TS 36.211 [21], clause 10.1.6. Value us66dot7 corresponds to 66.7 microseconds and value us266dot7 corresponds to 266.7 microseconds. If the UE uses a NPRACH resource for preamble format 2, the UE ignores the value signalled in nprach-CP-Length and considers the value to be 800 microseconds.
nprach-NumCBRA-StartSubcarriers
The number of start subcarriers from which a UE can randomly select a start subcarrier as specified in TS 36.321 [6].
If nprach-Config-v1330 is not included in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB, the UE sets the value of nprach-NumCBRA-StartSubcarriers-r13 to the value signalled by nprach-NumSubcarriers-r13 for the corresponding NPRACH resource.
The start subcarrier indices that the UE is allowed to randomly select from, are given by:
nprach-SubcarrierOffset + [0, nprach-NumCBRA-StartSubcarriers - 1].
See NOTE.
nprach-NumSubcarriers
Number of sub-carriers in a NPRACH resource, see TS 36.211 [21], clause 10.1.6. In number of subcarriers.
See NOTE.
nprach-ParametersList, nprach-ParametersListEDT
Configures NPRACH parameters for each NPRACH resource. Up to three PRACH resources can be configured in nprach-ParametersList in a cell. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a different number of NPRACH repetitions.
E-UTRAN includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order for nprach-ParametersListEDT, as in nprach-ParametersList in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB.
The NPRACH resources in nprach-ParametersListEDT are used to initiate EDT. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a TBS signalled in the corresponding entry of edt-TBS-InfoList.
For TDD: The UE shall use nprach-ParametersListTDD and ignore nprach-ParametersList.
nprach-ParametersListTDD
For TDD: Configure NPRACH parameters for each NPRACH. Up to three NPRACH resources can be configured in a cell. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a different number of NPRACH repetitions.
nprach-ParametersListFmt2, nprach-ParametersListFmt2EDT
Configures NPRACH parameters for each NPRACH resource format 2. Up to three NPRACH resources can be configured on one carrier. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a different number of NPRACH repetitions. E-UTRAN includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in nprach-ParametersList in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB.
The NPRACH resources in nprach-ParametersListFmt2EDT are used to initiate EDT. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a TBS signalled in the corresponding entry of edt-TBS-InfoList.
E-UTRAN configures the NPRACH resources format 2 so that they do not overlap in time domain with the NPRACH resources configured in nprach-ParametersList and nprach-ParametersListEDT.
If there is no NPRACH resource in nprach-ParametersListFmt2 (respectively nprach-ParametersListFmt2EDT) on any UL carrier for one NPRACH repetition level, the UE uses the NPRACH resources in nprach-ParametersList (respectively nprach-ParametersListEDT) for this NPRACH repetition level. Otherwise, the UE uses only NPRACH resources in nprach-ParametersListFmt2 (respectively nprach-ParametersListFmt2EDT).
nprach-Periodicity
Periodicity of a NPRACH resource, see TS 36.211 [21], clause10.1.6. Unit in millisecond.
See NOTE.
nprach-PreambleFormat
TDD: TDD preamble format, see TS 36.211 [21]. clause 10.1.6,
Value fmt0 corresponds to preamble format 0, value fmt1 corresponds to preamble format 1 and so on.
nprach-StartTime
Start time of the NPRACH resource in one period, see TS 36.211 [21], clause 10.1.6. Unit in millisecond.
See NOTE.
nprach-SubcarrierOffset
Frequency location of the NPRACH resource, see TS 36.211 [21], clause 10.1.6. In number of subcarriers, offset from sub-carrier 0.
See NOTE.
nprach-SubcarrierMSG3-RangeStart
Fraction for calculating the starting subcarrier index of the range reserved for indication of UE support for multi-tone Msg3 transmission, within the NPRACH resource, see TS 36.211 [21], clause 10.1.6. Multi-tone Msg3 transmission is not supported for {32, 64, 128} repetitions of NPRACH. For at least one of the NPRACH resources with the number of NPRACH repetitions other than {32, 64, 128}, the value of nprach-SubcarrierMSG3-RangeStart should not be 0.
If nprach-SubcarrierMSG3-RangeStart is equal to zero, no start subcarrier index for the single-tone Msg3 NPRACH is allocated and the start subcarrier indexes for the multi-tone Msg3 NPRACH partition are given by nprach-SubcarrierOffset + [0, nprach-NumCBRA-StartSubcarriers - 1].
If nprach-SubcarrierMSG3-RangeStart is equal to oneThird or twoThird, the start subcarrier indexes for the two partitions are given by:
nprach-SubcarrierOffset + [0, FLOOR (nprach-NumCBRA-StartSubcarriers * nprach-SubcarrierMSG3-RangeStart) -1]
for the single-tone Msg3 NPRACH partition;
nprach-SubcarrierOffset + [FLOOR (nprach-NumCBRA-StartSubcarriers * nprach-SubcarrierMSG3-RangeStart), nprach-NumCBRA-StartSubcarriers - 1]
for the multi-tone Msg3 NPRACH partition;
If nprach-SubcarrierMSG3-RangeStart is equal to one, the start subcarrier indexes for the single-tone Msg3 NPRACH are given by nprach-SubcarrierOffset + [0, nprach-NumCBRA-StartSubcarriers - 1] and no start subcarrier index for the multi-tone Msg3 NPRACH partition is allocated.
See NOTE.
numRepetitionsPerPreambleAttempt
Number of NPRACH repetitions per attempt for each NPRACH resource, See TS 36.211 [21], clause 10.1.6. numRepetitionsPerPreambleAttempt-r13 applies to FDD and numRepetitionsPerPreambleAttempt-v1550 applies to TDD.
rsrp-ThresholdsPrachInfoList
The criterion for UEs to select a NPRACH resource. Up to 2 RSRP threshold values can be signalled. The first element corresponds to RSRP threshold 1, the second element corresponds to RSRP threshold 2. See TS 36.321 [6]. If absent, there is only one NPRACH resource.
A UE that supports powerClassNB-14dBm-r14 shall correct the RSRP threshold values before applying them as follows:
RSRP threshold = Signalled RSRP threshold - min{0, (14-min(23, P-Max))} where P-Max: is the value of p-Max field in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB.

Parameter slot-reserved-resource-config-DL in TS 36.211 [21] and TS 36.213 [23]
The first/leftmost 2-bits corresponds to the subframe #0 of the radio frame satisfying SFN mod x = startPosition, where x is the periodicity of the reserved resource divided by 10. Two bits for each subframe coded as:
00: both slots are not reserved
01: the first slot is not reserved, the second slot is reserved
10: the first slot is reserved, the second slot is not reserved
11: both slots are reserved

startPosition
Start time of the resource reservation pattern in one period. Unit in multiple of 10 milliseconds.
E-UTRAN configures the value of startPosition such as startPosition * 10 < periodicity.

FDD/TDD
Yes

NOTE 1:	The IE UE-Capability-NB does not include AS security capability information, since these are the same as the security capabilities that are signalled by NAS. Consequently AS need not provide "man-in-the-middle" protection for the security capabilities.
NOTE 2:	The column 'FDD/TDD appl' indicates the applicability to the xDD mode: 'FDD' means applicable to FDD only, 'TDD' means applicable to TDD only and 'FDD/TDD' means applicable to FDD and TDD.
NOTE 3:	The column 'FDD/TDD diff' indicates if the UE is allowed to signal a different value for FDD and TDD when the capability applies to both FDD and TDD modes. '-' is used when the capability applies to one mode only, 'No' is used for dual mode capabilities where a common value is signalled for both modes, and 'Yes' is used for dual mode capabilities where a separate value is signalled for each mode. Common capabilities and FDD capabilities are reported in the fields of UE-Capability-NB except field tdd-UE-Capability. TDD capabilities are reported in tdd-UE-Capability.

8	Protocol data unit abstract syntax
8.1	General
The RRC PDU contents in clause 6, clause 9.3.2 and clause 10 are described using abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680 [13] and X.681 [14]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [15].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in X.691:
-	When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to 15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field.
NOTE:	The terms 'leading bit' and 'trailing bit' are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.680. When using the 'bstring' notation, the leading bit of the bit string value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the right.
-	When decoding types constrained with the ASN.1 Contents Constraint ("CONTAINING"), automatic decoding of the contained type should not be performed because errors in the decoding of the contained type should not cause the decoding of the entire RRC message PDU to fail. It is recommended that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that contains the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint, and then decodes the contained type that is nested within the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING as a separate step.
-	When decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC message PDU, BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
8.2	Structure of encoded RRC messages
An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer entities/ across the radio interface contains the basic production as defined in X.691.
RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC SDUs (in case of PCCH, BCCH, BR-BCCH, CCCH or MCCH) upon transmission and reception as follows:
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the RLC SDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of the PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the RLC SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.
8.3	Basic production
The 'basic production' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the abstract syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It always contains a multiple of 8 bits.
8.4	Extension
The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol extensions:
-	A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall, unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the extension part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may send non-empty extensions;
-	A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall set spare bits to zero;
8.5	Padding
If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC layer shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH, BCCH and BR-BCCH.
Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a multiple of 8.

9.2	Default radio configurations
The following clauses only list default values for REL-8 parameters included in protocol version v8.5.0. For all fields introduced in a later protocol version, the default value is "released" unless explicitly specified otherwise. If UE is to apply default configuration while it is configured with some critically extended fields, the UE shall apply the original version with only default values. For the following fields, introduced in a protocol version later than v8.5.0, the default corresponds with "value not applicable":
-	codeBookSubsetRestriction-v920;
-	pmi-RI-Report;
NOTE 1:	Value "N/A" indicates that the UE does not apply a specific value (i.e. upon switching to a default configuration, E-UTRAN can not assume the UE keeps the previously configured value). This implies that E-UTRAN needs to configure a value before invoking the related functionality.
NOTE 2:	In general, the signalling should preferably support a "release" option for fields introduced after v8.5.0. The "value not applicable" should be used restrictively, mainly limited to for fields which value is relevant only if another field is set to a value other than its default.

SL-Preconfiguration field descriptions
carrierFreq
Indicates the carrier frequency for out of coverage sidelink communication and sidelink discovery. In case of FDD it is uplink carrier frequency and the corresponding downlink frequency can be determined from the default TX-RX frequency separation defined in TS 36.101 [42], table 5.7.3-1.
additionalSpectrumEmission
The UE requirements related to IE AdditionalSpectrumEmission are defined in TS 36.101 [42], clause 6.2.4. If additionalSpectrumEmissionExt-r14 is configured, the UE only considers additionalSpectrumEmissionExt-r14 (and ignores additionalSpectrumEmission-r12).
commRxPoolList
Indicates a list of reception pools for sidelink communication in addition to the resource pools indicated by preconfigComm.
commTxPoolList
Indicates a list of transmission pools for sidelink communication in addition to the first resource pool within preconfigComm.
preconfigComm
Indicates a list of resource pools. The first resource pool in the list is used for both reception and transmission of sidelink communication. The other resource pools, if present, are only used for reception of sidelink communication.
syncRefDiffHyst
Hysteresis when evaluating a SyncRef UE using relative comparison. Value dB0 corresponds to 0 dB, dB3 to 3 dB and so on, value dBinf corresponds to infinite dB.
syncRefMinHyst
Hysteresis when evaluating a SyncRef UE using absolute comparison. Value dB0 corresponds to 0 dB, dB3 to 3 dB and so on.

NOTE 1:	The network may configure one or more of the reception only resource pools in preconfigComm to cover reception from in coverage UEs using scheduled resource allocation. For such a resource pool the network should set all bits of subframeBitmap to 1 and offsetIndicator to indicate the subframe immediately following the sidelink control information.
NOTE 2:	The network should ensure that the resources defined by the first entry in preconfigComm (used for transmission by an out of coverage UE) do not overlap with those of the pool(s) covering scheduled transmissions by in coverage UEs. Furthermore, the network should ensure that for none of the entries in preconfigComm the resources defined by sc-TF-ResourceConfig overlap.

SL-V2X-Preconfiguration field descriptions
adjacencyPSCCH-PSSCH
Indicates whether a UE always transmits PSCCH and PSSCH in adjacent RBs (indicated by TRUE) or it may transmit PSCCH and PSSCH in non-adjacent RBs (indicated by FALSE). This parameter appears only when a pool is configured such that a UE transmits PSCCH and the associated PSSCH in the same subframe.
anchorCarrierFreqList
Indicates carrier frequencies which may include inter-carrier resource configuration for V2X sidelink communication.
anchorCarrierFreqListNR
Indicates NR carrier frequencies which may include inter-carrier resource configuration for V2X sidelink communication.
cbr-PreconfigList
Indicates the preconfigured list of CBR ranges and the list of PSSCH transmission configurations available to configure congestion control to the UE for V2X sidelink communication.
cbr-pssch-TxConfigList
Indicates the mapping between PPPPs, CBR ranges by using indexes of the entry in cbr-RangeCommonConfigList in cbr-PreconfigList, and PSSCH transmission parameters and CR limits by using indexes of the entry in sl-CBR-PSSCH-TxConfigList in cbr-PreconfigList. 
numSubchannel
Indicates the number of subchannels in the corresponding resource pool.
offsetDFN
Indicates the timing offset for the UE to determine DFN timing when GNSS is used for timing reference. Value 0 corresponds to 0 milliseconds, value 1 corresponds to 0.001 milliseconds, value 2 corresponds to 0.002 milliseconds, and so on.
resourceSelectionConfigP2X
Indicates the allowed resource selection mechanism(s), i.e. partial sensing and/or random selection, for P2X related V2X sidelink communication.
restrictResourceReservationPeriod
If configured, the field restrictResourceReservationPeriod configured in v2x-ResourceSelectionConfig shall be ignored for transmission on this pool. 
sizeSubchannel
Indicates the number of PRBs of each subchannel in the corresponding resource pool. The value n5 denotes 5 PRBs; n6 denotes 6 PRBs and so on. The values n5, n6, n10, n15, n20, n25, n50, n75 and n100 apply in the case of adjacencyPSCCH-PSSCH set to TRUE; the values n4, n5, n6, n8, n9, n10, n12, n15, n16, n18, n20, n30, n48, n72 and n96 apply in the case of adjacencyPSCCH-PSSCH set to FALSE.

Indicates the offset of the first subframe of a resource pool within a SFN cycle. If absent, the resource pool starts from first subframe of SFN=0. This field is not applicable to V2X sidelink communication.
sl-Subframe
Indicates the bitmap of the resource pool, which is is defined by repeating the bitmap within a SFN cycle (see TS 36.213 [23]).
startRB-Subchannel
Indicates the lowest RB index of the subchannel with the lowest index.
startRB-PSCCH-Pool
Indicates the lowest RB index of the PSCCH pool.
syncAllowed
Indicates the allowed synchronization reference(s) which is (are) allowed to use the pre-configured resource pool. 
syncPriority
Indicates the synchronization priority order. In case the UE does not detect any cell which configures synchronization configuration on the carrier frequency in anchorCarrierFreqList, if this field is set to gnss, the UE shall prioritize GNSS over the UE directly synchronized to eNB; if this field is set to enb, the UE shall prioritize the UE directly synchronized to eNB over GNSS.
thresSL-TxPrioritization
Indicates the threshold used to determine whether SL V2X transmission is prioritized over uplink transmission if they overlap in time (see TS 36.321 [6]). 
threshS-RSSI-CBR
Indicates the S-RSSI threshold for determining the contribution of a sub-channel to the CBR measurement, as specified in TS 36.214 [48]. Value 0 corresponds to -112 dBm, value 1 to -110 dBm, value n to (-112 + n*2) dBm, and so on.

Indicates zone configurations used for V2X sidelink communication in 5.10.13.2.
zoneID
Indicates the zone ID for which the UE shall use this resource pool as described in 5.10.13.2. The field is absent in v2x-CommRxPoolList and p2x-CommTxPoolList in SL-V2X-PreconfigFreqInfo.

10	Radio information related interactions between network nodes
10.1	General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across the E-UTRA radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol extension mechanisms apply.
10.2	Inter-node RRC messages
10.2.1	General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2- or the S1-interface, either to or from the eNB, i.e. a single 'logical channel' is used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

HandoverPreparationInformation field descriptions
as-Config
The radio resource configuration. Applicable in case of intra-E-UTRA handover, resume or re-establishment. If the target receives an incomplete MeasConfig and/or RadioResourceConfigDedicated in the as-Config, the target eNB may decide to apply the full configuration option based on the ue-ConfigRelease.
as-Context
Local E-UTRAN context required by the target eNB.
makeBeforeBreakReq
To request the target eNB to add the makeBeforeBreak indication in the mobilityControlInfo in case of intra-frequency handover.
rrm-Config
Local E-UTRAN context used depending on the target node's implementation, which is mainly used for the RRM purpose. May also be provided at inter-RAT handover from NR.
sourceRB-ConfigIntra5GC
NR radio bearer config used at intra5GC handover, resume or re-establishment, as defined by RadioBearerConfig IE in TS 38.331 [82].
ue-ConfigRelease
Indicates the RRC protocol release or version applicable for the current UE configuration. This could be used by target eNB to decide if the full configuration approach should be used. If this field is not present, the target assumes that the current UE configuration is based on the release 8 version of RRC protocol. NOTE 1.
ue-RadioAccessCapabilityInfo
For E-UTRA radio access capabilities, it is up to E-UTRA how the backward compatibility among supportedBandCombinationReduced, supportedBandCombination and supportedBandCombinationAdd is ensured. If supportedBandCombinationReduced and supportedBandCombination/supportedBandCombinationAdd are included into ueCapabilityRAT-Container, it can be assumed that the value of fields, requestedBands, reducedIntNonContCombRequested and requestedCCsXL are consistend with all supported band combination fields. NOTE 2
ue-SupportedEARFCN
Includes UE supported EARFCN of the handover target E-UTRA cell if the target E-UTRA cell belongs to multiple frequency bands.

NOTE 1:	The source typically sets the ue-ConfigRelease to the release corresponding with the current dedicated radio configuration. The source may however also consider the common radio resource configuration e.g. in case interoperability problems would appear if the UE temporary continues extensions of this part of the configuration in a target PCell not supporting them.
NOTE 2:	The following table indicates per source RAT whether RAT capabilities are included or not.

10.5	Mandatory information in AS-Config
The AS-Config transferred between source eNB and target-eNB shall include all IEs necessary to describe the AS context. The conditional presence in clause 6 is only applicable for eNB to UE communication.
The "need" or "cond" statements are not applied in case of sending the IEs from source eNB to target eNB. Some fields shall be included regardless of the "need" or "cond" e.g. discardTimer. The AS-Config re-uses information elements primarily created to cover the radio interface signalling requirements. The information elements may include some parameters that are not relevant for the target eNB e.g. the SFN as included in the MasterInformationBlock.
All the fields in the AS-Config as defined in 10.3 that are introduced after v9.2.0 and that are optional for eNB to UE communication shall be included, if the functionality is configured, except for the fields sourceOtherConfigSN-NR and sourceRB-ConfigSN-NR in AS-ConfigNR. The fields in the AS-Config that are defined before and including v9.2.0 shall be included as specified in the following.
Within the sourceRadioResourceConfig, sourceMeasConfig and sourceOtherConfig, the source eNB shall include fields that are optional for eNB to UE communication, if the functionality is configured unless explicitly specified otherwise in the following:
-	in accordance with a condition that is explicitly stated to be applicable; or
-	a default value is defined for the concerned field; and the configured value is the same as the default value that is defined; or
-	the need of the field is OP and the current UE configuration corresponds with the behaviour defined for absence of the field;
The following fields, if the functionality is configured, are not mandatory for the source eNB to include in the AS-Config since delta signalling by the target eNB for these fields is not supported:
-	semiPersistSchedC-RNTI
-	measGapConfig
For the measurement configuration, a corresponding operation as 5.5.6.1 and 5.5.2.2a is executed by target eNB.
10.6	Inter-node NB-IoT messages

The AS-Config-NB re-uses information elements primarily created to cover the radio interface signalling requirements.
Within the sourceRadioResourceConfig, the source eNB shall include fields that are optional for eNB to UE communication, if the functionality is configured unless explicitly specified otherwise in the following:
-	in accordance with a condition that is explicitly stated to be applicable; or
-	a default value is defined for the concerned field; and the configured value is the same as the default value that is defined; or
-	the need of the field is OP and the current UE configuration corresponds with the behaviour defined for absence of the field;

11.3	Void
Annex A (informative):	Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1
A.1	Introduction
The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
A.2	Procedural specification
A.2.1	General principles
The procedural specification provides an overall high level description regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU clause e.g. general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple fields.
Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are send to E-UTRAN i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
A.2.2	More detailed aspects
The following more detailed conventions should be used:
-	Bullets:
-	Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are part of the sentence starting with 'The UE shall:'
-	All bullets, including the last one in a subclause, should end with a semi-colon i.e. an ';'
-	Conditions
-	Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in 'if cond1; or cond2:
A.3	PDU specification
A.3.1	General principles
A.3.1.1	ASN.1 sections
The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [13], X.681 (02/2002) [14].
The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in the specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1 code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins with a text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 start tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "ASN1START" (in all upper case letters). Each ASN.1 section ends with a text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 stop tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text "ASN1STOP" (in all upper case letters):
-- ASN1START

-- ASN1STOP

The text paragraphs containing the ASN.1 start and stop tags should not contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the order they appear, throughout the specification.
NOTE:	A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.
A.3.1.2	ASN.1 identifier naming conventions
The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should be based on the following guidelines:
-	Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without hyphenation. These identifiers, e.g., the RRCConnectionModificationCommand, should be used for reference in the procedure text. Abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.
-	Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case, with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a capital, e.g., EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since the "d" in "Selected" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-TimeDifference.
-	Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case thereafter, e.g., establishmentCause. If a field identifier begins with an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is lowercase (plmn-Identity, not pLMN-Identity). The acronym is set off with a hyphen (ue-Identity, not ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers.
-	Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent possible.
-	Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use 'Meas' instead of 'Measurement' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.
-	For future extension: When an extension is introduced a suffix is added to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/ or type. A suffix of the form "‑rX" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/ first release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, e.g., Foo-r9 for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type Foo. A suffix of the form "‑rXb" is used for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same release (X) as the original version of the field, "‑rXc" for a second intra-release revision and so on. A suffix of the form "‑vXYZ" is used for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding earlier field or type (see subclause A.4), e.g., AnElement-v10b0 for the extension of the ASN.1 type AnElement introduced in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number 0...9, 10, 11, etc. is used to represent the first part of the version number, indicating the release of the protocol. Lower case letters a, b, c, etc. are used to represent the second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than 9. In the procedural specification, in field descriptions as well as in headings suffices are not used, unless there is a clear need to distinguish the extension from the original field.
-	More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the identifiers e.g. MeasObjectUTRA, ConfigCommon. When there is no particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the different variants.

NOTE:		The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.
A.3.1.3	Text references using ASN.1 identifiers
A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the specification is made using the ASN.1 field or type identifier of the referenced element. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text references should be in the italic font style. The "do not check spelling and grammar" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., " ") should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type identifier.
A reference to an RRC PDU type should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier followed by the word "message", e.g., a reference to the RRCConnectionRelease message.
A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field identifier followed by the word "field", e.g., a reference to the prioritisedBitRate field in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=			SEQUENCE {
	ul-SpecificParameters				SEQUENCE {
		priority							Priority,
		prioritisedBitRate					PrioritisedBitRate,
		bucketSizeDuration					BucketSizeDuration,
		logicalChannelGroup					INTEGER (0..3)
	}		OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

NOTE:	All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 sections, used as examples in this annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted from the specification.
A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym "IE", e.g., a reference to the IE LogicalChannelConfig in the example above.
References to a specific type of information element should only be used when those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be used in the text reference.
A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the ASN.1 value, e.g., 'if the status field is set to value true'.
A.3.2	High-level message structure
Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types are alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
	message					DL-DCCH-MessageType
}

DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
	c1						CHOICE {
		dlInformationTransfer					DLInformationTransfer,
		handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest		HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
		mobilityFromEUTRACommand				MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
		rrcConnectionReconfiguration			RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
		rrcConnectionRelease					RRCConnectionRelease,
		securityModeCommand						SecurityModeCommand,
		ueCapabilityEnquiry						UECapabilityEnquiry,
		spare1 NULL
	},
	messageClassExtension	SEQUENCE {}
}

-- ASN1STOP

A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU types are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE.
Spare alternatives (i.e., spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).
Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated using the messageClassExtension alternative in the outer level CHOICE.
A.3.3	Message definition
Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::=	SEQUENCE {
	rrc-TransactionIdentifier			RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
	criticalExtensions					CHOICE {
		c1									CHOICE{
			rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8		RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,
			spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
		},
		criticalExtensionsFuture			SEQUENCE {}
	}
}

RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
	-- Enter the IEs here.
	...
}

-- ASN1STOP
Hooks for critical and non-critical extension should normally be included in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further described in subclause A.4.
Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not comprehended by the decoder.
Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., spare3 down to spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE. The number of spare alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the future releases of the protocol.
Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original specifications are used up, is facilitated using the criticalExtensionsFuture in the outer level CHOICE.
In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases of the protocol, the inner level c1 CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be excluded, as shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
	rrc-TransactionIdentifier			RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
	criticalExtensions					CHOICE {

Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.
Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker "...". The original specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at the end of the sequence of information elements contained.
Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of an empty sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::=					SEQUENCE {
	field1									InformationElement1,
	field2									InformationElement2,
	nonCriticalExtension					SEQUENCE {}						OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a field description table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g. because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that needs to be specified.
%PDU-TypeIdentifier% field descriptions
%field identifier%
Field description.
%field identifier%
Field description.

The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.
The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall include a first paragraph with a field identifier (in bold and italic font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style), e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/ or specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of the PDU.
The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be omitted from the field description table.
A.3.4	Information elements
Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-ConfigSIB ::=					SEQUENCE {
	rootSequenceIndex					INTEGER (0..1023),
	prach-ConfigInfo					PRACH-ConfigInfo
}

PRACH-Config ::=					SEQUENCE {
	rootSequenceIndex					INTEGER (0..1023),
	prach-ConfigInfo					PRACH-ConfigInfo					OPTIONAL	-- Need ON
}

PRACH-ConfigInfo ::=				SEQUENCE {
	prach-ConfigIndex					ENUMERATED {ffs},
	highSpeedFlag						ENUMERATED {ffs},
	zeroCorrelationZoneConfig			ENUMERATED {ffs}
}

-- ASN1STOP

IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the same set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.
A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in this example, are preferably placed together in a common ASN.1 section. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base, defined as the generic type identifier. It may be complemented by a suffix to distinguish the different variants. The "PRACH-Config" is the generic type identifier in this example, and the "SIB" suffix is added to distinguish the variant. The subclause heading and generic references to a group of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type identifier.
The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of an existing IE is created for critical or non-critical extension of the protocol (see subclause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of the IE is included in the same ASN.1 section defining the original. A suffix is added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in subclause A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new version, or extension version, was introduced.
Local IE type definitions, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo in the example above, may be included in the ASN.1 section and be referenced in the other IE types defined in the same ASN.1 section. The use of locally defined IE types should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data elements, to be used in the software implementation.
An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo, should not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 sections in the RRC specification. An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 section should be defined in a separate subclause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1 section (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in the example above). Such IE types are also referred to as 'global IEs'.
NOTE:	Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the context of another ASN.1 section, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline level of the specification. It should be avoided.
The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the example above, may be followed by a field description table, where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in subclause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of the field description table is the same as shown in subclause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type.
A.3.5	Fields with optional presence
A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a value for that field in the encoding:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PreambleInfo ::=					SEQUENCE {
	numberOfRA-Preambles				INTEGER (1..64)						DEFAULT 1,
	...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted. The omission carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of the field:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-Config ::=				SEQUENCE {
	rootSequenceIndex					INTEGER (0..1023),
	prach-ConfigInfo					PRACH-ConfigInfo					OPTIONAL	-- Need ON
}

-- ASN1STOP

The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted, should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need statement. The need statement includes the keyword "Need", followed by one of the predefined semantics tags (OP, ON or OR) defined in subclause 6.1. If the semantics tag OP is used, the semantics of the absent field are further specified either in the field description table following the ASN.1 section, or in procedure text.
The addition of OPTIONAL keywords for capability groups is based on the following guideline. If there is more than one field in the lower level IE, then OPTIONAL keyword is added at the group level. If there is only one field in the lower level IE, OPTIONAL keyword is not added at the group level.
A.3.6	Fields with conditional presence
A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the keyword "Cond", followed by a condition tag associated with the field ("UL" in this example):
-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=			SEQUENCE {
	ul-SpecificParameters				SEQUENCE {
		priority							INTEGER (0),
		...
	}		OPTIONAL																	-- Cond UL
}

-- ASN1STOP

When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 section, the field description table after the ASN.1 section shall be followed by a conditional presence table. The conditional presence table specifies the conditions for including the fields with conditional presence in the particular ASN.1 section.
Conditional presence
Explanation
UL
Specification of the conditions for including the field associated with the condition tag = "UL". Semantics in case of optional presence under certain conditions may also be specified.

The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading: "Conditional presence") contains the condition tag (in italic font style), which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 section to an entry in the table. The second column (heading: "Explanation") contains a text specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of the field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an optional presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.
Conditional presence should primarily be used when presence of a field despends on the presence and/ or value of other fields within the same message. If the presence of a field depends on whether another feature/ function has been configured, while this function can be configured indepedently e.g. by another message and/ or at another point in time, the relation is best reflected by means of a statement in the field description table.
If the ASN.1 section does not include any fields with conditional presence, the conditional presence table shall not be included.
Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of conditional presence should be considered.
A.3.7	Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF construct in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE data type, an information element shall be defined for the list elements even if it would not otherwise be needed.
For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as in the following example:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::=				SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityInfo

PLMN-IdentityInfo ::=				SEQUENCE {
	plmn-Identity						PLMN-Identity,
	cellReservedForOperatorUse			ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP
rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated code to contain types with unpredictable names:
-- /bad example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityList ::=					SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {
	plmn-Identity							PLMN-Identity,
	cellReservedForOperatorUse				ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP
A.3.8	Guidelines on use of parameterised type SetupRelease
The usage of the parameterised type SetupRelease is like a function call using an information element as parameter. I.e. to use it, an IE has to be defined that specifies the sequence of fields that apply for choice value setup. Let's take an example.
-- /example/ ASN1START

InformationElementA ::=		SEQUENCE {
	field1						BOOLEAN,
	field2						CHOICE {
		release						NULL,
		setup						SEQUENCE {
			field2a						INTEGER (0..7)						OPTIONAL, 	-- Need OR
			field2b						InformationElement2b
		}																	OPTIONAL	-- Need ON
	}
}

-- ASN1STOP

Using SetupRelease this example can be specified as follows:
-- /example/ ASN1START

InformationElementA ::=		SEQUENCE {
	field1						BOOLEAN,
	field2						SetupRelease { InformationElement2 }	OPTIONAL	--  Need ON
}


InformationElement2 ::=		SEQUENCE {
	field2a						INTEGER (0..7)							OPTIONAL, 	-- Need OR
	field2b						InformationElement2b
}

-- ASN1STOP

The two versions are equivalent in abstract syntax i.e. use of SetupRelease is like an editorial change.
A.4	Extension of the PDU specifications
A.4.1	General principles to ensure compatibility
It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on different versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In particular, this requirement applies for the following kind of protocol extensions:
-	Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected behaviour or damage).
-	Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it should be possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the handling of the other parts of the message).
-	Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If used, the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.
It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring of extensions may not be required.
The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for introducing protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is used merely when there is a need to introduce a 'clean' message version. Such a need appears when the last message version includes a large number of non-critical extensions, which results in issues like readability, overhead associated with the extension markers. The critical extension mechanism may also be considered when it is complicated to accommodate the extensions by means of non-critical extension mechanisms.
A.4.2	Critical extension of messages and fields
The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There are both "outer branch" and "inner branch" mechanisms available. The "outer branch" consists of a CHOICE having the name criticalExtensions, with two values, c1 and criticalExtensionsFuture. The criticalExtensionsFuture branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the "inner branch" mechanism.
The "inner branch" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form "MessageName-rX-IEs" (e.g., "RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs") or "spareX", with the spare values having type NULL. The "-rX-IEs" structures contain the complete structure of the message IEs for the appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10 version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional Rel-10 fields.
The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an 'outer branch', or an 'outer branch' in combination with an 'inner branch' including a certain number of spares:
-	For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.
-	An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.
-	The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values). The estimation of the critical extension likelyhood may be based on the number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.
-	In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions are added using the outer branch.
The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release
-- /example/ ASN1START					-- Original release

RRCMessage ::=							SEQUENCE {
	rrc-TransactionIdentifier				RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
	criticalExtensions					CHOICE {
		c1									CHOICE{
			rrcMessage-r8						RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
			spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
		},
		criticalExtensionsFuture			SEQUENCE {}
	}
}

-- ASN1STOP

-- /example/ ASN1START					-- Later release

RRCMessage ::=							SEQUENCE {
	rrc-TransactionIdentifier				RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
	criticalExtensions					CHOICE {
		c1									CHOICE{
			rrcMessage-r8						RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
			rrcMessage-r10						RRCMessage-r10-IEs,
			rrcMessage-r11						RRCMessage-r11-IEs,
			rrcMessage-r14						RRCMessage-r14-IEs
		},
		later							CHOICE {
			c2									CHOICE{
				rrcMessage-r16						RRCMessage-r16-IEs,
				spare7 NULL, spare6 NULL, spare5 NULL, spare4 NULL,
				spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
			},
			criticalExtensionsFuture				SEQUENCE {}
		}
	}
}

-- ASN1STOP

It is important to note that critical extensions may also be used at the level of individual fields i.e. a field may be replaced by a critically extended version. When sending the extended version, the original version may also be included (e.g. original field is mandatory, EUTRAN is unaware if UE supports the extended version). In such cases, a UE supporting both versions may be required to ignore the original field. The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release
-- /example/ ASN1START					-- Original release

RRCMessage ::=							SEQUENCE {
	rrc-TransactionIdentifier				RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
	criticalExtensions					CHOICE {
		c1									CHOICE{
			rrcMessage-r8						RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
			spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
		},
		criticalExtensionsFuture			SEQUENCE {}
	}
}

RRCMessage-rN-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
	field1-rN							ENUMERATED {
											value1, value2, value3, value4}	OPTIONAL,	-- Need ON
	field2-rN							InformationElement2-rN				OPTIONAL,	-- Need ON
	nonCriticalExtension				RRCConnectionReconfiguration-vMxy-IEs	OPTIONAL
}

RRCConnectionReconfiguration-vMxy-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
	field2-rM							InformationElement2-rM			OPTIONAL, -- Cond NoField2rN
	nonCriticalExtension				SEQUENCE {}						OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

Conditional presence
Explanation
NoField2rN
The field is optionally present, need ON, if field2-rN is absent. Otherwise the field is not present

Finally, it is noted that a critical extension may be introduced in the same release as the one in which the original field was introduced e.g. to correct an essential ASN.1 error. In such cases a UE capability may be introduced, to assist E-UTRAN in deciding whether or not to use the critically extension.
A.4.3	Non-critical extension of messages
A.4.3.1	General principles
The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional guidelines apply:
-	When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has been critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in earlier critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.
-	The extension marker ("…") is the primary non-critical extension mechanism that is used unless a length determinant is not required. Examples of cases where a length determinant is not required:
-	at the end of a message,
-	at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING
-	When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned parameter belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as the 'default extension location')
-	It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version of the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest possible level.
-	In specific cases it may be preferrable to place extensions elsewhere (referred to as the 'actual extension location') e.g. when it is possible to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group should be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message.
-	In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following higher level in the message should be considered.
-	In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an IE should be defined. The IE's ASN.1 definition should be placed in the same ASN.1 section as the default extension location. In case there are intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension location, an IE may be defined for each level. Intermediate levels are primarily introduced for readability and overview. Hence intermediate levels need not allways be introduced e.g. they may not be needed when the default and the actual extension location are within the same ASN.1 section.
A.4.3.2	Further guidelines
Further to the general principles defined in the previous clause, the following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension markers:
-	Extension markers within SEQUENCE
-	Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the higher nesting levels
-	Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields as well as for information elements whose extension would result in complex structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list)
-	Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT
-	Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages on BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully
-	The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the specification are grouped together using double brackets.
-	Extension markers within ENUMERATED
-	Spare values are used until the number of values reaches the next power of 2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit
-	A suffix of the form "vXYZ" is used for the identifier of each new value, e.g. "value-vXYZ".
-	Extension markers within CHOICE:
-	Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g. ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is not required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports the extended value.
-	A suffix of the form "vXYZ" is used for the identifier of each new choice value, e.g. "choice-vXYZ".
Non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an OCTET or BIT STRING:
-	When a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a "Need" statement should not be provided for the field, which always is a group including at least one extension and a field facilitating further possible extensions. For simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a "Need" statement when the field is not actually used either.
Further, more general, guidelines:
-	In case a need statement is not provided for a group, a "Need" statement is provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e. including for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to clarify the action upon absence of the whole group.
A.4.3.3	Typical example of evolution of IE with local extensions
The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a number of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension mechanism is used.
NOTE	In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n while the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the release n receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more advanced mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.
-- /example/ ASN1START

	field2								CHOICE {
		field2a								BOOLEAN,

	...,
	[[	field3-v1170						InformationElement3-v1170		OPTIONAL	-- Need OR
	]]
}

-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions of InformationElement1 as shown in the above example:
–	The InformationElement1 is initially extended with a number of non-critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of the IE InformationElement1 (i.e. InformationElement1-r10) is defined in which the earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the original field.
–	The value4-v880 is replacing a spare value defined in the original protocol version for field1. Likewise value6-v1170 replaces spare3 that was originally defined in the r10 version of field1
–	Within the critically extended release 10 version of InformationElement1, the names of the original fields/ IEs are not changed, unless there is a real need to distinguish them from other fields/ IEs. E.g. the field1 and InformationElement4 were defined in the original protocol version (release 8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the field3-r9 is introduced in release 9 and not re-tagged; although, the InformationElement3 is also critically extended and therefore tagged InformationElement3-r10 in the release 10 version of InformationElement1.
A.4.3.4	Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a message
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::=			SEQUENCE {
	field1							InformationElement1,
	field2							InformationElement2,
	field3							InformationElement3					OPTIONAL,	-- Need ON
	nonCriticalExtension			RRCMessage-v860-IEs					OPTIONAL
}

RRCMessage-v860-IEs ::=			SEQUENCE {
	field4-v860						InformationElement4					OPTIONAL,	-- Need OP
	field5-v860						BOOLEAN								OPTIONAL,	-- Cond C54
	nonCriticalExtension			RRCMessage-v940-IEs					OPTIONAL
}

RRCMessage-v940-IEs ::=			SEQUENCE {
	field6-v940						InformationElement6-r9					OPTIONAL,	-- Need OR
	nonCriticalExtensions			SEQUENCE {}								OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
–	The InformationElement4 is introduced in the original version of the protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.
A.4.3.5	Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default extension location
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case an extension is not placed at the default extension location.
–	ParentIE-WithEM
The IE ParentIE-WithEM is an example of a high level IE including the extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM and ChildIE2-WithoutEM which not include the extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.
The example illustrates how the two extension IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 and ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 (both in release N) are used to connect non-critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs to the actual extension location in this IE.
ParentIE-WithEM information element
-- /example/ ASN1START

ParentIE-WithEM ::=					SEQUENCE {
	-- Root encoding, including:
	childIE1-WithoutEM					ChildIE1-WithoutEM				OPTIONAL,		-- Need ON
	childIE2-WithoutEM					ChildIE2-WithoutEM				OPTIONAL,		-- Need ON
	...,
	[[	childIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0				ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0		OPTIONAL,		-- Need ON
		childIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0				ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0		OPTIONAL		-- Need ON
	]]
}

-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
–	The fields childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0 may not really need to be optional (depends on what is defined at the next lower level).
–	In general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.

–	ChildIE1-WithoutEM
The IE ChildIE1-WithoutEM is an example of a lower level IE, used to control certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be setup or released using the local IE ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature. The example illustrates how the new field chIE1-NewField is added in release N to the configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the following assumptions:
–	when initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.
–	when the configurable feature is released, the new field should be released also.
–	when omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).
–	when omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).
The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.

A.5	Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC messages
The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a Transaction identifier
1:	DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC_IDLE should not include the RRC transaction identifier.
2:	All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC transaction identifier.
3:	All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4:	All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an RRC transaction identifier.
5:	All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction identifier.
A.6	Protection of RRC messages (informative)
The following list provides information which messages can be sent (unprotected) prior to security activation and which messages can be sent unprotected after security activation. Those messages indicated "-" in "P" column should never be sent unprotected by eNB or UE. Further requirements are defined in the procedural text.
P…Messages that can be sent (unprotected) prior to security activation
A - I…Messages that can be sent without integrity protection after security activation
A - C…Messages that can be sent unciphered after security activation
NA… Message can never be sent after security activation

A.7	Miscellaneous
The following miscellaneous conventions should be used:
-	References: Whenever another specification is referenced, the specification number and optionally the relevant clause, table or figure, should be indicated in addition to the pointer to the References clause e.g. as follows: 'see TS 36.212 [22, 5.3.3.1.6]'.
-	UE capabilities: TS 36.306 [5] specifies that E-UTRAN should in general respect the UE's capabilities. Hence there is no need to include statement clarifying that E-UTRAN, when setting the value of a certain configuration field, shall respect the related UE capabilities unless there is a particular need e.g. particularly complicated cases.
Annex B (normative):	Release 8 and 9 AS feature handling
B.1	Feature group indicators
This annex contains the definitions of the bits in fields featureGroupIndicators (in Table B.1-1) and featureGroupIndRel9Add (in Table B.1-1a).
In this release of the protocol, the UE shall include the fields featureGroupIndicators in the IE UE-EUTRA-Capability and featureGroupIndRel9Add in the IE UE-EUTRA-Capability-v9a0. All the functionalities defined within the field featureGroupIndicators defined in Table B.1-1 or Table B.1-1a are mandatory for the UE (with exceptions for category M1 and M2 UEs), if the related capability (frequency band, RAT, SR-VCC or Inter-RAT ANR) is also supported. For a specific indicator, if all functionalities for a feature group listed in Table B.1-1 have been implemented and tested, the UE shall set the indicator as one (1), else (i.e. if any one of the functionalities in a feature group listed in Table B.1-1 or Table B.1-1a, which have not been implemented or tested), the UE shall set the indicator as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators that correspond to RATs not supported by the UE as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators, which do not have a definition in Table B.1-1 or Table B.1-1a, as zero (0).
If the optional fields featureGroupIndicators or featureGroupIndRel9Add are not included by a UE of a future release, the network may assume that all features pertaining to the RATs supported by the UE, respectively listed in Table B.1-1 or Table B.1-1a and deployed in the network, have been implemented and tested by the UE.
In Table B.1-1, a 'VoLTE capable UE' corresponds to a UE which is IMS voice capable and a 'MCPTT capable UE' corresponds to a UE which supports MCPTT voice application as defined in TS 23.179 [73].
The indexing in Table B.1-1a starts from index 33, which is the leftmost bit in the field featureGroupIndRel9Add.

NOTE:	The column FDD/ TDD diff indicates if the UE is allowed to signal different values for FDD and TDD. Annex E specifies for which TDD and FDD serving cells a UE supporting TDD/FDD CA shall support a feature for which it indicates support within the FGI signalling.

Clarification for mobility from EUTRAN and inter-frequency handover within EUTRAN
There are several feature groups related to mobility from E-UTRAN and inter-frequency handover within EUTRAN. The description of these features is based on the assumption that we have 5 main "functions" related to mobility from E-UTRAN:
A.	Support of measurements and cell reselection procedure in idle mode
B.	Support of RRC release with redirection procedure in connected mode
C.	Support of Network Assisted Cell Change in connected mode
D.	Support of measurements and reporting in connected mode
E.	Support of handover procedure in connected mode
All functions can be applied for mobility to Inter-frequency to EUTRAN, GERAN, UTRAN, CDMA2000 HRPD and CDMA2000 1xRTT except for function C) which is only applicable for mobility to GERAN. Table B.1-2 below summarises the mobility functions that are supported based on the UE capability signaling (band support) and the setting of the feature group support indicators.

In case measurements and reporting function is not supported by UE, the network may still issue the mobility procedures redirection (B) and CCO (C) in a blind fashion.
B.2	CSG support
In this release of the protocol, it is mandatory for the UE to support a minimum set of CSG functionality consisting of:
-	Identifying whether a cell is CSG or not;
-	Ignoring CSG cells in cell selection/reselection.
Additional CSG functionality in AS, i.e. the requirement to detect and camp on CSG cells when the "CSG whitelist" is available or when manual CSG selection is triggered by the user, are related to the corresponding NAS features. This additional AS functionality consists of:
-	Manual CSG selection;
-	Autonomous CSG search;
-	Implicit priority handling for cell reselection with CSG cells.
It is possible that this additional CSG functionality in AS is not supported or tested in early UE implementations.
Note that since the above AS features relate to idle mode operations, the capability support is not signalled to the network. For these reasons, no "feature group indicator" is assigned to this feature to indicate early support in Rel-8.

Annex C (normative):	Release 10 AS feature handling
C.1	Feature group indicators
This annex contains the definitions of the bits in field featureGroupIndRel10.
In this release of the protocol, the UE shall include the field featureGroupIndRel10 in the IE UE-EUTRA-Capability-v1020-IEs. All the functionalities defined within the field featureGroupIndRel10 defined in Table C.1-1 are mandatory for the UE, if the related capability (spatial multiplexing in UL, PDSCH transmission mode 9, carrier aggregation, handover to EUTRA, or RAT) is also supported. For a specific indicator, if all functionalities for a feature group listed in Table C.1-1 have been implemented and tested, the UE shall set the indicator as one (1), else (i.e. if any one of the functionalities in a feature group listed in Table C.1-1 have not been implemented or tested), the UE shall set the indicator as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators that correspond to RATs not supported by the UE as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators, which do not have a definition in Table C.1-1, as zero (0).
If the optional field featureGroupIndRel10 is not included by a UE of a future release, the network may assume that all features, listed in Table C.1-1 and deployed in the network, have been implemented and tested by the UE.
The indexing in Table C.1-1 starts from index 101, which is the leftmost bit in the field featureGroupIndRel10.

NOTE:	The column FDD/ TDD diff indicates if the UE is allowed to signal different values for FDD and TDD. Annex E specifies for which TDD and FDD serving cells a UE supporting TDD/FDD CA shall support a feature for which it indicates support within the FGI signalling.
Annex D (informative):	Descriptive background information
D.1	Signalling of Multiple Frequency Band Indicators (Multiple FBI)
D.1.1	Mapping between frequency band indicator and multiple frequency band indicator
This clause describes the use of the Multiple Frequency Band Indicator (MFBI) lists and the E-UTRA frequency bands in SystemInformationBlockType1 by means of an example as shown in Figure D.1.1-1. In this example:
-	E-UTRAN cell belongs to band B90 and also bands B6, B7, B91, and B92.
-	The freqBandIndicatorPriority field is not present in SystemInformationBlockType1.
-	E-UTRAN uses B64 to indicate the presence of B90 in freqBandIndicator-v9e0.
-	For the MFBI list of this cell, E-UTRAN uses B64 in MultiBandInfoList to indicate the position and priority of the bands in MultiBandInfoList-v9e0.
-	The UE, after reading SystemInformationBlockType1, generates an MFBI list with priority of B91, B6, B92, and B7. If the UE supports the frequency band in the freqBandIndicator-v9e0 IE it applies that frequency band. Otherwise, the UE applies the first listed band in the MFBI list which it supports.

Figure D.1.1-1: Mapping of frequency bands to MultiBandInfoList/MultiBandInfoList-v9e0
D.1.2	Mapping between inter-frequency neighbour list and multiple frequency band indicator
This clause describes the use of the Multiple Frequency Band Indicator (MFBI) lists and the E-UTRA frequencies signalled in SystemInformationBlockType5 by means of an example as shown in Figure D.1.2-1. In this example:
-	E-UTRAN includes 4 frequencies (EARFCNs): the bands associated with f1 and f4 belong to bands lower than 64; the bands associated with f2 and f3 belong to bands larger than 64. The reserved EARFCN value of 65535 is used to indicate the presence of ARFCN-ValueEUTRA-v9e0.
-	The band associated with f1 has two overlapping bands, B1 and B2 (lower than 64); the band associated with f2 has one overlapping band, B91; the band associated with f3 has four overlapping bands B3, B4, B92, and B93; the band associated with f4 does not have overlapping bands.
-	E-UTRAN includes 4 lists in both interFreqCarrierFreqList-v8h0 and interFreqCarrierFreqList-v9e0 and ensure the order of the lists is matching. Each list corresponds to one EARFCN and contains up to 8 bands. The first list corresponds to f1, the second list corresponds to f2, and so on. The grey lists mean not including MultiBandInfoList or MultiBandInfoList-v9e0, i.e. the corresponding EARFCN does not have any overlapping frequency bands in MultiBandInfoList or MultiBandInfoList-v9e0.

D.1.3	Mapping between UTRA FDD frequency list and multiple frequency band indicator
This clause describes the use of the Multiple Frequency Band Indicator (MFBI) lists and the UTRA FDD frequencies signalled in SystemInformationBlockType6 by means of an example as shown in Figure D.1.3-1. In this example:
-	E-UTRAN includes 4 UTRA FDD frequencies (UARFCNs).
-	The bands associated with f1 and f4 have no overlapping bands. The band associated with f2 has two overlapping bands, B1 and B2. The band associated with f3 has one overlapping band, B3.
-	E-UTRAN includes 4 lists in carrierFreqListUTRA-FDD-v8h0 with the first and fourth entry not including MultiBandInfoList.

Annex E (normative):	TDD/FDD differentiation of FGIs/capabilities in TDD-FDD CA
Annex E specifies for which TDD and FDD serving cells a UE supporting TDD/FDD CA shall support a feature/capability for which it indicates support within the FGI/capability signalling.
A UE that indicates support for TDD/ FDD CA:
-	For the fields for which the UE is allowed to indicate different	support for FDD and TDD, the UE shall support the feature on the PCell and/or SCell(s), as specified in tables E-1, E-2 and E-3 in accordance to the following rules:
-	PCell: the UE shall support the feature for the PCell, if the UE indicates support of the feature for the PCell duplex mode;
-	SCell: the UE shall support the feature for SCell(s), if the UE indicates support of the feature for the SCell duplex mode;
-	Per serving cell: the UE shall support the feature for a serving cell if the UE indicates support of the feature for the serving cell's duplex mode;
-	All serving cells: UE shall support the feature if the UE indicates support of the feature for both TDD and FDD duplex modes;
-	For the fields where the UE is not allowed to indicate different support for FDD and TDD, the UE shall support the feature for PCell and SCell(s) if the UE indicates support of the feature via the common FGI/capability bit.

Annex F (normative):	UE requirements on ASN.1 comprehension
This clause specifies UE requirements regarding the ASN.1 transfer syntax support i.e. the ASN.1 definitions to be comprehended by the UE.
A UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease shall comprehend the entire transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X, in particular at least the first version upon ASN.1 freeze. The UE is however not required to support dedicated signalling related transfer syntax associated with optional features it does not support.
In case a UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease supports a feature specified in release X+ N (i.e. early UE implementation) additional requirements apply.
Cricitical extensions (dedicated signaling)
If the early implemented feature involves one or more critical extensions (i.e. case of dedicated signaling), the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X+ N that are related to the feature implemented early. This in particular concerns the ASN.1 parts related to configuration of the feature. The UE obviously also has to support the ASN.1 parts related to indicating support of the feature (in UE capabilities).
If configuration of an early implemented feature introduced in release X+ N involves a message or field that has been critically extended, the UE shall support configuration of all features supported by the UE that are associated with sub-fields of this critical extension. Apart from the early implemented feature(s), the UE need however not support functionality beyond what is defined in the release the UE indicates in access stratum release.
Let's consider the example of a UE indicating value X in field accessStratumRelease that supports the features associated with fields A1, A3 and A5 of InformationElementA (see ASN.1 below). The feature implemented early is associated with field A5, and can only be configured by the –rX+N version of InformationElementA. In such case, the UE should support configuration of the features associated with fields A1, A3 and A5 by the –rX+N version of InformationElementA. If however one of the features was modified, e.g. the feature associated with fieldA3, E-UTRAN should assume the UE only supports the feature according to the release it indicated in field accessStratumRelease (X). I.e. UE is neither required to support the additional code-point (n80-vX+N0) nor the additional sub-field (fieldA3a).
InformationElementA-rX ::=		SEQUENCE {
	fieldA1-rX						InformationElementA1-rX				OPTIONAL,	-- Need ON
	fieldA2-rX						InformationElementA2-rX				OPTIONAL,	-- Need OR
	fieldA3-rX						InformationElementA3-rX				OPTIONAL	-- Need OR

										 n80-vX+N0}						OPTIONAL,	-- Need OR
	fieldA3a-rX+N					InformationElementA3a-rX+N			OPTIONAL	-- Need OR
}

Non-cricitical extensions (broadcast signaling)
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions in broadcast signaling (i.e. system information), the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X+ N that are related to the feature implemented early. The SIB(s) containing the release X+ N fields related to the early implemented features may also include other extensions concerning releases from X upto X+N. The UE shall comprehend such intermediate fields (but again is not required to support the functionality associated with these intermediate fields, in case this concerns optional features not supported by the UE).
