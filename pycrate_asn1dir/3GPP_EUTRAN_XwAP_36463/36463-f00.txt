3	Definitions and abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
Elementary Procedure: XwAP protocol consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An XwAP Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between an eNB and WT. An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success or failure),
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
eNB UE XwAP ID: Defined in TS 36.401 [9].
E-RAB: Defined in TS 36.401 [9].
LWA bearer: Defined in TS 36.300 [2].
LWIP-SeGW: Defined in TS 33.401 [17].
UE-associated signalling: Refers to XwAP messages associated to one UE, and which use the respective UE-associated logical Xw connection.
UE-associated logical Xw connection: The UE-associated logical Xw connection transports UE-associated signalling. The identities WT UE XwAP ID and eNB UE XwAP ID are used to identify the particular UE-associated logical Xw connection that a message relates to.
WLAN Termination: Defined in TS 36.300 [2].
WT UE XwAP ID: Defined in TS 36.401 [9].
3.2	Abbreviations

4	General
4.1	Procedure specification principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the initiating message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see section 10.
4.2	Forwards and backwards compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g. Handover Preparation procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. E-RAB ID IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in sub clause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Value".
5	XwAP services
5.1	General
The present clause describes the services offered between an eNB and WT.
5.2	XwAP procedures
The Xw interface XwAP procedures may be UE-associated or non UE-associated. UE-associated XwAP procedures are used to handle the configuration and modification to support LWA or LWIP for a specific UE. Non UE-associated procedures support LWA, RCLWI and/or LWIP, and are not related to a specific UE.
5.3	Parallel transactions
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any instance in time one protocol peer shall have a maximum of one ongoing XwAP procedure related to a certain UE.
6	Services expected from signalling transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of XwAP messages. XwAP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
Xw signalling transport is described in TS 36.462 [4].
7	Functions of XwAP
The XwAP protocol provides the following functions:
-	Setting up the Xw. This function is used to exchange the necessary data for the eNB and the WT to set up the Xw interface and implicitly perform an Xw Reset.
-	WT Configuration Update. This function allows updating of application level data needed for the eNB and the WT to interoperate correctly on the Xw interface.
-	WLAN Status Reporting. This function allows the eNB to configure reporting of load-related information from the WT.
-	LTE-WLAN Aggregation. This function allows the eNB to request a WT to provide radio resources for LWA operation for a certain UE while keeping responsibility for that UE.
-	LTE-WLAN Radio Level Integration with IPsec Tunnel. This function allows the eNB to request a WT to provide tunnel resources for LWIP operation for a certain UE while keeping responsibility for that UE.
-	Reporting of General Error Situations. This function allows reporting of general error situations, for which function specific error messages have not been defined.
-	Resetting the Xw. This function is used to reset the Xw interface.
The mapping between the above functions and Xw EPs is shown in the table below.

8.2	Xw Setup
8.2.1	General
The purpose of the Xw Setup procedure is to exchange application level configuration data needed for the eNB and the WT to interoperate correctly over the Xw interface. This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data in the two nodes and replaces it by the one received. This procedure also resets the Xw interface.
The procedure uses non-UE-associated signalling.
8.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2-1: Xw Setup, successful operation
An eNB initiates the procedure by sending the Xw SETUP REQUEST message to a candidate WT. The candidate WT replies with the Xw SETUP RESPONSE message. The candidate WT shall reply with a list of relevant WLAN identifiers.
If the WLAN Usage IE is included in the WLAN Information IE, the eNB shall consider that the relevant WLAN identifier(s) may be used for both LWA and LWIP, or for LWIP only; otherwise, the relevant WLAN identifier(s) may be used for LWA only.
If the Neighbour eNB Information IE is included in the Xw SETUP RESPONSE message, the eNB shall consider the included information as the list of eNBs to which the WT is connected.
8.2.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.2.3-1: Xw Setup, unsuccessful operation
If the candidate WT cannot accept the setup, it shall respond with an Xw SETUP FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value.
If the Xw SETUP FAILURE message includes the Time To Wait IE the initiating eNB shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the Xw Setup procedure towards the same WT.
8.2.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the first message received for a specific TNL association is not an Xw SETUP REQUEST, Xw SETUP RESPONSE, or Xw SETUP FAILURE message, then this shall be treated as a logical error.
8.3	WT Configuration Update
8.3.1	General
The purpose of the WT Configuration Update procedure is to update application level configuration data needed for an eNB and a WT to interoperate correctly over the Xw interface.
The procedure uses non-UE-associated signalling.
8.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.2-1: WT Configuration Update, successful operation
A WT initiates the procedure by sending a WT CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to an eNB. Such message shall include an appropriate set of up-to-date configuration data, including, but not limited to, relevant lists of added, modified and deleted WLAN identifiers that the WT has just taken into operational use.
If the WLAN Usage IE is included in the WLAN Information IE, the eNB shall consider that the relevant WLAN identifier(s) may be used for both LWA and LWIP, or for LWIP only; otherwise, the relevant WLAN identifier(s) may be used for LWA only.
If the Neighbour eNB Information IE is included in the WT CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB shall consider the included information as the full updated list of eNBs to which the WT is connected.
8.3.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.3.3-1: WT Configuration Update, successful operation
If the eNB cannot accept the update, it shall respond with a WT CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value.
If the WT CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message includes the Time To Wait IE the WT shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the WT Configuration Update procedure towards the same eNB. Both nodes shall continue to operate the Xw with their existing configuration data.
8.3.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.4	WT Status Reporting Initiation
8.4.1	General
This procedure is used by an eNB to request the reporting of load measurements to a WT.
The procedure uses non-UE-associated signalling.
8.4.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.2-1: WT Status Reporting Initiation procedure, successful operation
The procedure is initiated with a WT STATUS REQUEST message sent from the eNB to the WT. Upon receipt, the WT shall initiate the requested measurement according to the parameters given in the request in case the Registration Request IE is set to "start" and shall stop all measurements and terminate the reporting in case the Registration Request IE is set to “stop".
If the Registration Request IE is set to "start" then the Report Characteristics IE shall be included in WT STATUS REQUEST message.
The Report Characteristics IE indicates the type of objects WT shall perform measurements on.
For each BSS, the WT shall include in the WT STATUS REPORT message:
-	the BSS Load IE, if the first bit, “BSS Load” of the Report Characteristics IE included in the WT STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1;
-	the WAN Metrics IE, if the second bit, “WAN Metrics” of the Report Characteristics IE included in the WT STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1;
-	the Available Channel Utilization IE, if the third bit, “Available Channel Utilization” of the Report Characteristics IE included in the WT STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1.
If the Reporting Periodicity IE is included in the WT STATUS REQUEST message, the WT shall use its value as the time interval between two subsequent WT STATUS REPORT messages.
If the WT is capable to provide all requested resource status information, it shall initiate the measurement as requested by the eNB, and respond with the WT STATUS RESPONSE message.
If the WT is capable to provide some but not all of the requested resource status information and the Partial Success Indicator IE is present in the WT STATUS REQUEST, it shall initiate the measurement for the admitted measurement objects and include the Measurement Initiation Result IE in the WT STATUS RESPONSE message.
If the WT received a WT STATUS REQUEST message which includes the Registration Request IE set to "stop", it shall ignore the Report Characteristics, the BSS To Report List, the Reporting Periodicity, and the Partial Success Indicator IEs.
8.4.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.4.3-1: WT Status Reporting Initiation procedure, unsuccessful operation
If none of the requested measurements can be initiated, the WT shall send a WT STATUS FAILURE message. The Cause IE shall be set to an appropriate value for each requested measurement object. The eNB may include the Complete Failure Cause Information IE in the WT STATUS FAILURE message.
8.4.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB does not receive either WT STATUS RESPONSE message or WT STATUS FAILURE message, the eNB may reinitiate the WT Status Reporting Initiation procedure towards the WT, provided that the content of the new WT STATUS REQUEST message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged WT STATUS REQUEST message.
If the eNB receives the WT STATUS RESPONSE message including the Measurement Initiation Result IE containing no admitted measurements, the eNB shall consider the procedure as failed.
If the Registration Request IE is set to "start" and the Report Characteristics IE bitmap is set to "0" (all bits are set to "0") in the WT STATUS REQUEST message, then the WT shall initiate a WT STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "ReportCharacteristicsEmpty".
If the Registration Request IE is set to "start" and the Reporting Periodicity IE value is not specified, then the WT shall initiate a WT STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "No Report Periodicity".
If the WT received a WT STATUS REQUEST message which includes the Registration Request IE set to "start" and the eNB Measurement ID IE corresponding to an existing on-going load measurement reporting, then the WT shall initiate a WT STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "ExistingMeasurement ID".
If the Registration Request IE is set to "stop" and the WT STATUS REQUEST message does not contain WT Measurement ID IE, the WT shall consider the procedure as failed and respond with the WT STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "Unknown Measurement ID".
8.5	WT Status Reporting
8.5.1	General
This procedure is initiated by the WT to report the result of measurements admitted by the WT following a successful WT Status Reporting Initiation procedure.
The procedure uses non-UE-associated signalling.
8.5.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.5.2-1: WT Status Reporting procedure, successful operation
The WT shall report the results of the admitted measurements in the WT STATUS REPORT message. The admitted measurements are the measurements that were successfully initiated during the preceding WT Status Reporting Initiation procedure.
8.5.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.5.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.6	Error Indication
8.6.1	General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node to report detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message which used UE-associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE-associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.6.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.6.2-1: Error Indication procedure, eNB originated. Successful operation.

Figure 8.6.2-2: Error Indication procedure, WT originated. Successful operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE. In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by UE associated signalling, the eNB UE XwAP ID IE and the WT UE XwAP ID IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If one or both of eNB UE XwAP ID IE and the WT UE XwAP ID IE are not correct, the cause shall be set to an appropriate value, e.g., “Unknown eNB UE XwAP ID”, “Unknown WT UE XwAP ID” or “Unknown pair of UE XwAP ID”.

8.7	Reset
8.7.1	General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to align the resources in the eNB and in the WT in the event of an abnormal failure. The procedure resets the Xw interface. This procedure does not affect the application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the Xw Setup procedure.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.7.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.2-1: Reset, eNB-initiated. Successful operation.

Figure 8.7.2-2: Reset, WT-initiated. Successful operation.
The procedure is initiated with a RESET message sent from the initiating node. Upon receipt of this message, the receiving node shall abort any other ongoing procedures (except another Reset procedure) over Xw with the initiating node. The receiving node shall delete all the context information related to the initiating node, except the application level configuration data exchanged during Xw Setup or WT Configuration Update procedures, and release the corresponding resources. After completing the release of the resources, the receiving node shall respond with a RESET RESPONSE message.
8.7.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.7.4	Abnormal Conditions
If Reset procedure is ongoing and the receiving node receives the RESET message from the peer entity on the same Xw interface, the receiving node shall respond with the RESET RESPONSE message as described in 8.7.2.
8.8	WT Addition Preparation
8.8.1	General
The purpose of the WT Addition Preparation procedure is to request the WT to allocate resources for LWA operation for a specific UE.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling and, in case of successful operation, establishes a new UE-associated logical Xw-connection.
8.8.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.8.2-1: WT Addition Preparation, successful operation
The eNB initiates the procedures by sending the WT ADDITION REQUEST message to the WT.
The allocation of resources according to the values of the Allocation and Retention Priority IE included in the E-RAB Level QoS Parameters IE shall follow the principles described for the E-RAB Setup Procedure in TS 36.413 [8].
NOTE:	Due to inherent features of the WLAN radio interface, it may not always be possible to guarantee a bit rate. If the GBR QoS Information IE is present in the WT ADDITION REQUEST, the WT may accept the request even though it may not be able to guarantee the bit rate signalled in the GBR QoS Information IE. The eNB may therefore need to monitor the bit rate of offloaded GBR bearers.
If the WT ADDITION REQUEST message contains the Serving PLMN IE, the WT may take it into account for the allocation of resources for LWA.
If the WT ADDITION REQUEST message contains the WT UE XwAP ID IE, the WT shall use the included information to identify the UE.
If the DRB-Identity IE is present in an item in the E-RABs To Be Added List IE in the WT ADDITION REQUEST message, the WT shall consider that the respective LWA bearer is configured for uplink.
At reception of the WT ADDITION REQUEST message the WT shall:
-	use the information included in the Mobility Set IE as the WLAN Mobility Set configured for LWA, as defined in TS 36.300 [2];
-	store the WLAN Security Information IE, if included, and use it to establish the required security relation towards the UE.
The WT shall report to the eNB, in the WT ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the result for all the requested E-RABs in the following way:
-	A list of E-RABs which are successfully established shall be included in the E-RABs Admitted To Be Added List IE.
-	A list of E-RABs which failed to be established shall be included in the E-RABs Not Admitted List IE.
For each admitted uplink E-RAB to be added, the WT may include the LWA WLAN AC IE in the WT ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, and, if included, the eNB shall use the respective information as the LWA WLAN Access Category to be forwarded to the UE, as specified in TS 36.300 [2].
If the WT ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message contains the WT MAC Address IE, the eNB shall, if supported, communicate this information to the UE.
8.8.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.8.3-1: WT Addition Preparation, unsuccessful operation
If the WT is not able to accept at least one of the bearers or a failure occurs during the WT Addition Preparation, the WT sends the WT ADDITION REQUEST REJECT message with an appropriate cause value to the eNB.
8.8.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the WT receives a WT ADDITION REQUEST message containing multiple E-RAB ID IEs (in the E-RABs To Be Added List IE) set to the same value, the WT shall consider the establishment of the corresponding E-RAB as failed.
If the WT receives a WT ADDITION REQUEST message containing an E-RAB Level QoS Parameters IE which contains a QCI IE indicating a GBR bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 [13]), and which does not contain the GBR QoS Information IE, the WT shall consider the establishment of the corresponding E-RAB as failed.
If the WT receives a WT ADDITION REQUEST message containing the WT UE XwAP ID IE but it is not able to identify the UE, it shall reply with the WT ADDITION REQUEST REJECT message with an appropriate cause value.
8.9	eNB Initiated WT Modification
8.9.1	General
This procedure is used to enable an eNB to request a WT to modify the UE context at the WT.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.9.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.9.2-1: eNB initiated WT Modification, successful operation

The WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message may contain within the UE Context Information IE:
-	E-RABs to be added within the E-RABs To Be Added Item IE;
-	E-RABs to be modified within the E-RABs To Be Modified Item IE;
-	E-RABs to be released within the E-RABs To Be Released Item IE;
-	WLAN security information in the WLAN Security Information IE.
If the WLAN Security Information IE is included in the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message the WT shall store the information contained in this IE, and use it to establish the required security relation towards the UE.
The allocation of resources according to the values of the Allocation and Retention Priority IE included in the E-RAB Level QoS Parameters IE shall follow the principles described for the E-RAB Setup procedure in TS 36.413 [8].
NOTE:	Due to inherent features of the WLAN radio interface, it may not always be possible to guarantee a bit rate. If the GBR QoS Information IE is present in the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST, the WT may accept the request even though it may not be able to guarantee the bit rate signalled in the GBR QoS Information IE. The eNB may therefore need to monitor the bit rate of offloaded GBR bearers.
If the DRB-Identity IE is present in an item in the E-RABs To Be Added List IE in the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the WT shall consider that the respective LWA bearer is configured for uplink.
If the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message contains the Serving PLMN IE, the WT may take it into account for the allocation of resources for LWA.
If at least one of the requested modifications is admitted by the WT, the WT shall modify the related part of the UE context accordingly and send the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message back to the eNB.
The WT shall include the E-RABs for which resources have been either added or modified or released at the WT either in the E-RABs Admitted To Be Added List IE or the E-RABs Admitted To Be Modified List IE or the E-RABs Admitted To Be Released List IE. The WT shall include the E-RABs that have not been admitted in the E-RABs Not Admitted List IE with an appropriate cause value.
For each admitted uplink E-RAB to be added or modified, the WT may include the LWA WLAN AC IE in the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, and, if included, the eNB shall use the respective information as the LWA WLAN Access Category to be forwarded to the UE, as specified in TS 36.300 [2].
For each E-RAB to be modified, if the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message includes the eNB GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE in the E-RABs To Be Modified Item IE, the WT shall act as specified in TS 36.300 [2].
For each E-RAB to be released, if the DL Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE is included within the E-RABs To Be Released Item IE in the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the WT may perform data forwarding of downlink packets for that bearer.
If the E-RAB level QoS parameter IE is included in the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message for an E-RAB to be modified, the WT shall allocate respective resources as described in TS 36.300 [2].
For an E-RAB to be modified, the WT may include in the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the WT GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE.
If the Mobility Set IE is included in the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the WT shall use the information included in this IE as the WLAN Mobility Set configured for LWA, as defined in TS 36.300 [2].
8.9.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.9.3-1: eNB initiated WT Modification, unsuccessful operation
If the WT does not admit any modification requested by the eNB, or a failure occurs during the eNB initiated WT Modification, the WT shall send the WT MODIFICATION REQUEST REJECT message to the eNB. The message shall contain the Cause IE with an appropriate value.
8.9.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the WT receives a WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message containing multiple E-RAB ID IEs (in the E-RABs To Be Added List IE and/or the E-RABs To Be Modified List IE) set to the same value, the WT shall not admit the action requested for the corresponding E-RABs.
If the WT receives a WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message containing multiple E-RAB ID IEs (in the E-RAB To Be Released List IE) set to the same value, the WT shall initiate the release of one corresponding E-RAB and ignore the duplication of the instances of the selected corresponding E-RABs.
If the WT receives a WT MODIFICATION REQUEST message containing a E-RAB Level QoS Parameters IE which contains a QCI IE indicating a GBR bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 [13]), and which does not contain the GBR QoS Information IE, the WT shall not admit the corresponding E-RAB.
Interaction with the WT initiated WT Modification procedure:
If the eNB, after having initiated the eNB initiated WT Modification procedure, receives the WT MODIFICATION REQUIRED message, the eNB shall refuse the WT initiated WT Modification procedure with an appropriate cause value in the Cause IE.
8.10	WT Initiated WT Modification
8.10.1	General
This procedure is used by the WT to modify the UE context in the WT. In particular, in this Release of the specification, this procedure is used to request to the eNB the release of LWA bearers, or change their WT GTP Tunnel Endpoints.

9.2	Information Element definitions
9.2.0	General
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table. In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the concerned capability is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause values indicate that the concerned capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.
Radio Network Layer cause
Meaning
WLAN not Available
The concerned WLAN is not available.
Unknown eNB UE XwAP ID
The action failed because the eNB UE XwAP ID is unknown.
Unknown WT UE XwAP ID
The action failed because the WT UE XwAP ID is unknown.
Unknown Pair of UE XwAP ID
The action failed because the pair of UE XwAP IDs is unknown.
Security Failure
The action is requested (or a previous request by the receiving node failed) due to a failure in security procedures.
ReportCharacteristicsEmpty
The action failed because there is no characteristic reported.
Existing Measurement ID
The action failed because Measurement ID is already used.
Unknown Measurement ID
The action failed because some eNB or WT Measurement ID is unknown.
Measurement Temporarily not Available
The WT can temporarily not provide the requested measurement object.
Multiple E-RAB ID Instances
The action failed because multiple instances of the same E-RAB had been provided to the WT.
Switch Off Ongoing
The reason for the action is an ongoing switch off i.e. either the sending node, or nodes whose actions the sending node triggers or monitors, will be switched off and not be available. It aids the receiving node in taking subsequent actions. 
Not supported QCI value
The action failed because the requested QCI is not supported.
Unspecified
Sent when none of the above cause values applies but still the cause is Radio Network Layer related.
Measurement not Supported For The Object
At least one of the concerned BSS(s) does not support the requested measurement.
Reduce Load
The action is requested in order to reduce load in an element controlled by the sending node.
Resource Optimisation
The reason for requesting this action is to improve the load distribution.
Target not Allowed
Requested action towards the indicated target is not allowed for the UE in question.
No Radio Resources Available
The action failed because of insufficient radio resources in the requested node.
Invalid QoS combination
The action was failed because of invalid QoS combination.
Procedure cancelled
The sending node cancelled the procedure due to other urgent actions to be performed.
Radio Connection With UE Lost
The action is requested due to losing the radio connection to the UE.
Failure in the Radio Interface Procedure
Radio interface procedure has failed.
No Report Periodicity
The action failed because the periodicity is not defined.
Wrong WLAN Interworking Mode
The WT cannot support the requested WLAN interworking mode (LWA or LWIP), or it cannot handle a procedure related to one of the modes, or the requested mode is not configured for the UE.

Transport Network Layer cause
Meaning
Transport resource unavailable
The required transport resources are not available.
Unspecified
Sent when none of the above cause values applies but still the cause is Transport Network Layer related

Protocol cause
Meaning
Abstract Syntax Error (Reject)
The received message included an abstract syntax error and the concerned criticality indicated "reject" (see sub clause 10.3 of TS 36.413 [8]).
Abstract Syntax Error (Ignore and Notify)
The received message included an abstract syntax error and the concerned criticality indicated "ignore and notify" (see sub clause 10.3 of TS 36.413 [8]).
Abstract Syntax Error (falsely constructed message)
The received message contained IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences (see sub clause 10.3 of TS 36.413 [8]).
Message not Compatible with Receiver State
The received message was not compatible with the receiver state (see sub clause 10.4 of TS 36.413 [8]).
Semantic Error
The received message included a semantic error (see sub clause 10.4 of TS 36.413 [8]).
Transfer Syntax Error
The received message included a transfer syntax error (see sub clause 10.2 of TS 36.413 [8]).

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.1	General
XwAP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.680 [6] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [7].
Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the XwAP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of XwAP messages. XwAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct an XwAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE:	In the above, "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE IDs.
If an XwAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
9.3.2	Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor inter-operability.
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.

9.4	Message transfer syntax
XwAP shall use the ASN.1 Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER) Aligned Variant as transfer syntax, as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [5].
10	Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
Clause 10 of TS 36.413 [8] is applicable for the purposes of the present document, with the following addition to the handling of AP IDs specified in clause 10.6.
If a node receives a message (other than the first or first returned messages) that includes AP ID(s) identifying a logical connection which is known to the node (for the same Xw interface), but was established for the LWIP operation whereas the message relates to LWA operation (or vice-versa), the node shall behave as if the AP ID(s) identify a logical connection which is unknown to the node. If the node subsequently initiates an Error Indication procedure as part of the error handling described in clause 10.6 of TS 36.413 [8], it shall include an appropriate cause value such as "Wrong WLAN Interworking Mode".
