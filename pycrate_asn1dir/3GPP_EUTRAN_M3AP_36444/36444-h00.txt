3	Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
Elementary Procedure: M3AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between MCEs and the EPC. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as stand alone procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of several M3AP EPs together or together with EPs from other interfaces is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g. TS 23.246 [6] and TS 36.300 [3]).
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
-	On time supervision expiry (i.e. absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
-	One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined for successful outcome.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
MCE MBMS M3AP ID: Unique identity, referencing the MBMS-service-associated logical M3-connection within an MCE.
MME MBMS M3AP ID: Unique identity, referencing the MBMS-service-associated logical M3-connection within an MME.
MBMS E-RAB: An MBMS E-RAB refers to the concatenation of an M1 bearer and the corresponding radio bearer, as defined in TS 36.300 [3].
MBMS-service-associated signalling: When M3AP messages associated to one MBMS service uses the MBMS-service-associated logical M3-connection for association of the message to the MBMS service in MCE and EPC.
MBMS-service-associated logical M3-connection: The MBMS-service-associated logical M3-connection uses the identities MME MBMS M3AP ID and MCE MBMS M3AP ID. For a received MBMS service associated M3AP message the MME identifies the associated MBMS service based on the MME MBMS M3AP ID IE and the MCE identifies the associated MBMS service based on the MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE.

4	General
4.1	Procedure specification principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the MCE exactly and completely. The EPC functional behaviour is left unspecified. 
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see section 10. 
4.2	Forwards and backwards compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g. MBMS procedure.

Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. MESSAGE NAME message.

IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. Information Element IE.

Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in subclause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Value".
5	M3AP Services
M3AP provides the signalling service between MCE and EPC that is required to fulfil the M3AP functions described in clause 7. M3AP services are defined as
MBMS associated services: They are related to the whole M3 interface instance between the MCE and MME utilising an MBMS associated signalling connection.
Non MBMS associated services: They are related to the whole M3 interface instance between the MCE and MME utilising a Non MBMS associated signalling connection.
6	Services Expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of M3AP messages. M3AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
7	Functions of M3AP
The M3AP protocol provides the following functions:
-	Session Management. This overall functionality is responsible for starting, stopping and updating MBMS sessions.
-	Reset functionality to ensure a well defined initialisation on the M3 interface.
-	Error Indication functionality to allow a proper error reporting/handling in cases where no failure messages are defined. 
-	M3 Setup functionality for initial M3 interface setup for providing configuration information.
-	MCE Configuration Update function is to update application level configuration data needed for the MCE and MME to interoperate correctly on the M3 interface.
The mapping between the above functions and M3 EPs is shown in the table below.

The following applies concerning interference between Elementary Procedures:
-	The Reset procedure takes precedence over all other EPs.
8.2	MBMS Session Start
8.2.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Start procedure is to request the MCE to determine whether an MBMS E-RAB for an upcoming MBMS Session for a given MBMS Bearer Service can be accommodated by the E-UTRAN. The MCE is also requested to establish an MBMS service associated logical M3 connection. The MBMS Session Start procedure is triggered by the EPC (MME).
The procedure uses MBMS Service associated signaling.
8.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2-1: MBMS Session Start procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message to the MCE.
If the MCE receives the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message including the MBMS Cell List IE, the MCE may use it as defined in TS 36.300 [3].
In MBSFN operation
-	The MCE shall use the information in the MBMS E-RAB QoS parameters IE to determine whether the requested configuration can be accommodated within E-UTRAN.
-	If the Time of MBMS Data Transfer IE is included in the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message, the MCE shall, if supported, take it into account for the synchronization of the corresponding MCCH Update instead of the Minimum Time to MBMS Data Transfer IE. The MCE shall ensure the eNB applies the MCCH update from the last modification period before the time indicated by the Time of MBMS Data Transfer IE.
In SC-PTM operation, the MCE shall forward the information in the MBMS E-RAB QoS parameters IE to the relevant eNBs.
If the MCE receives the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message including the Re-establishment IE for a service which is already ongoing, it shall, if supported, accept this message and replace the MBMS context for that service (see TS 23.007 [14]).
If the MCE receives the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message including the Alternative TNL Information IE, it may send the content of that IE to the eNB.
The MCE shall report to the MME, in the MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message the result of the requested MBMS E-RAB.
In MBSFN operation, the MCE shall establish or modify the resources according to the values of the Allocation and Retention Priority IE (priority level and pre-emption indicators) and the resource situation as follows:
-	The MCE shall consider the priority level of the requested session, when deciding on the resource allocation.
-	The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (individually or in combination) be used to determine whether the session has to be started unconditionally and immediately. If the requested session is marked as “may trigger pre-emption” and the resource situation requires so, the MCE may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced release of a lower priority session which is marked as “pre-emptable”. Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption procedure is operator-dependent, the pre-emption indicators shall be treated as follows:
1.	If the Pre-emption Capability IE is set to “may trigger pre-emption”, then this allocation request is allowed to trigger a pre-emption procedure.
2.	If the Pre-emption Capability IE is set to “shall not trigger pre-emption”, then this allocation request is not allowed to trigger a pre-emption procedure.
3.	If the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE is set to “pre-emptable”, then this session shall be included in the pre-emption process.
4.	If the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE is set to “not pre-emptable”, then this session shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
5.	If the Priority Level IE is set to “no priority”, the given values for the Pre-emption Capability IE and Pre-emption Vulnerability IE shall not be considered. Instead the values “shall not trigger pre-emption” and “not pre-emptable” shall prevail.
-	The E-UTRAN pre-emption process shall keep the following rule: E-UTRAN shall only pre-empt sessions with lower priority, in ascending order of priority.
8.2.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.2.3-1: MBMS Session Start procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the MCE determines that the E-UTRAN is not able to accommodate the requested configuration for any involved MBSFN area when using MBSFN transmission, or in any involved cell when using SC-PTM, the MME shall be informed by the MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message including a suitable cause value.
If the MCE receives MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message including the MBMS Cell List IE and the list includes no cell controlled by eNB with which the MCE has connection, the MME shall be informed by the MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message including a suitable cause value, e.g. “Un-involved MCE”.
8.2.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.3	MBMS Session Stop
8.3.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Stop procedure is to inform the MCE about the end of an ongoing MBMS Session for a given MBMS Bearer Service, and that the E-UTRAN releases the allocated MBMS E-RAB resources and that the associated MBMS service associated logical M3 connection is also released. The MBMS Session Stop procedure is triggered by the EPC (MME).
The procedure uses MBMS Service associated signaling.
8.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.2-1: MBMS Session Stop procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message to the MCE. Upon receipt of the MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message, the MCE shall send the MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE message after the MCE releases the affected resources and removes the MBMS bearer context.
If the Time of MBMS Data Stop IE is included in the MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message, the MCE shall, if supported, take it into account for the synchronization of the corresponding MCCH Update. The MCE shall ensure the eNB applies the MCCH update from the first modification period after the time indicated by the Time of MBMS Data Stop IE.
8.3.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.3.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.4	Error Indication
8.4.1	General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node to report detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising MBMS-service-associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses MBMS-service-associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non MBMS-service-associated signalling.
8.4.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.2-1. Error Indication procedure, MME originated. Successful operation.

Figure 8.4.2.1-2. Error Indication procedure, MCE originated. Successful operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE.
In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by utilising MBMS-service-associated signalling the MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE and the MME MBMS M3AP IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If one or both of MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE and the MME MBMS M3AP IE are not correct, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "Unknown or already allocated MCE MBMS M3AP ID", "Unknown or already allocated MME MBMS M3AP ID" or "Unknown or inconsistent pair of MBMS M3AP ID". 
8.4.3	Abnormal Conditions
8.5	Reset
8.5.1	General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the E-UTRAN, or part of E-UTRAN M3AP MBMS-related contexts, in the event of a failure in the EPC or vice versa. This procedure does not affect the application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g. the M3 Setup procedure.
The procedure uses non MBMS-service associated signalling.
8.5.2	Successful Operation
8.5.2.1	Reset Procedure Initiated from the MME


Figure 8.5.2.1-1: Reset procedure initiated from the MME. Successful operation.
In the event of a failure at the MME, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the MCE.
At reception of RESET message the MCE shall release all allocated resources on M3 related to MBMS-service association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the MBMS-service contexts including MBMS M3AP IDs for the indicated MBMS service associations.
After the MCE has released all assigned M3 resources and the MBMS M3AP IDs for all indicated MBMS service associations which can be used for new MBMS-service-associated logical M3-connections over the M3 interface, the MCE shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
If the RESET message contains the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection list IE, then:
-	The MCE shall use the MME MBMS M3AP ID IE and/or the MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE to explicitly identify the MBMS service association(s) to be reset.
-	The MCE shall in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message include, for each MBMS service association to be reset, the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection list IE. The MBMS-Service -associated logical M3-connection Item IEs shall be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connections. Empty MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the MME MBMS M3AP ID IE is included in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE for an MBMS service association, the MCE shall include the MME MBMS M3AP ID IE in the corresponding MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE is included in an MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE for an MBMS service association, the MCE shall include the MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE in the corresponding MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
Interactions with other procedures:
If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except another Reset procedure) on the same M3 interface related to an MBMS service association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be aborted.
8.5.2.2	Reset Procedure Initiated from the E-UTRAN


Figure 8.5.2.2-1: Reset procedure initiated from the E-UTRAN. Successful operation.
In the event of a failure at the MCE, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the MME.
At reception of RESET message the MME shall release all allocated resources on M3 related to the MBMS service association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the MBMS M3AP ID for the indicated MBMS service associations. 
After the MME has released all assigned M3 resources and the MBMS M3AP IDs for all indicated MBMS service associations which can be used for new MBMS-service-associated logical M3-connections over the M3 interface, the MME shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. 
If the RESET message contains the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection list IE, then:
-	The MME shall use the MME MBMS M3AP ID IE and/or the MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE to explicitly identify the MBMS service association(s) to be reset.
-	The MME shall in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message include, for each MBMS service association to be reset, the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection list IE. The MBMS-Service -associated logical M3-connection Item IEs shall be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connections. Empty MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the MME MBMS M3AP ID IE is included in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE for an MBMS service association, the MME shall include the MME MBMS M3AP ID IE in the corresponding MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE is included in an MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE for an MBMS service association, the MME shall include the MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE in the corresponding MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
Interactions with other procedures:
If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except another Reset procedure) on the same M3 interface related to an MBMS service association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be aborted.
8.5.3	Abnormal Conditions
8.5.3.1	Abnormal Condition at the EPC
If the RESET message includes the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection list IE, but neither the MME MBMS M3AP ID IE nor the MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE is present for an MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE, then the MME shall ignore the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE. The MME may return the empty MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection list IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
8.5.3.2	Abnormal Condition at the E-UTRAN
If the RESET message includes the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection list IE, but neither the MME MBMS M3AP ID IE nor the MCE MBMS M3AP ID IE is present for an MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE, then the MCE shall ignore the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE. The MCE may return the empty MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection Item IE in the MBMS-Service-associated logical M3-connection list IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
8.5.3.3	Crossing of Reset Messages
If Reset procedure is ongoing in MCE and the MCE receives a RESET message from the peer entity on the same M3 interface related to one or several MBMS service associations previously requested to be reset, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the received RESET message, the MCE shall respond with RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.5.2.1.
If Reset procedure is ongoing in MME and the MME receives a RESET message from the peer entity on the same M3 interface related to one or several MBMS service associations previously requested to be reset, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the received RESET message, the MME shall respond with RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.5.2.2.
8.6	MBMS Session Update
8.6.1	General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Update procedure is to inform the MCE about changing characteristics of the MBMS session.
The procedure uses MBMS-Service-associated signalling.
8.6.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.6.2-1. MBMS Session Update procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message to the MCE. 
The MCE shall use the information contained in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message to update its own parameters of this session such as the service area parameters, or the list of cell identities, or the allocation and retention priority (ARP) of the session. In MBSFN operation, if the ARP parameter is updated, the corresponding update of resources shall follow the principles described for the MBMS Session Start procedure. The MCE shall then, if needed, transfer the updated parameters to the involved eNBs according to the service area, or the list of cell identities.
In MBSFN operation, if the Time of MBMS Data Transfer IE is included in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message, the MCE shall, if supported, take it into account for the synchronization of the corresponding MCCH Update instead of the Minimum Time to MBMS Data Transfer IE. The MCE shall ensure the eNB applies the MCCH update from the last modification period before the time indicated by the Time of MBMS Data Transfer IE. The MCE shall ignore the information contained in the received Minimum Time to MBMS Data Transfer IE.
After receiving the response from the involved eNBs the MCE shall report to the MME in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message the result of the update.
8.6.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.6.3-1: MBMS Session Update procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the MCE determines that the E-UTRAN is not able to accommodate the requested updating, the MCE shall send to the MME the MBMS SESSION UPDATE FAILURE message.
8.6.4	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.7	M3 Setup
8.7.1	General
The purpose of the M3 Setup procedure is to exchange application level data needed for the MCE and MME to correctly interoperate on the M3 interface. The procedure uses non MBMS-service associated signalling.
This procedure erases any existing application level data in the MCE and the MME and replaces it by the one received. This procedure also re-initialises the E-UTRAN M3AP service-related contexts (if any) and erases all related MBMS-service-associated logical M3 connections in the two nodes like a Reset procedure would do.
8.7.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.2-1: M3 Setup procedure- Successful operation.
The MCE initiates the procedure by sending a M3 SETUP REQUEST message including the appropriate data to the MME. The MME responds with a M3 SETUP RESPONSE.
The exchanged data shall be stored in respective node and used for the duration of the TNL association.
If the M3 SETUP REQUEST message contains the MCE Name IE the MME may use this IE as a human readable name of the MCE.
8.7.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.7.3-1: M3 Setup procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the MME cannot accept the setup, it should respond with a M3 SETUP FAILURE and appropriate cause value.
If the M3 SETUP FAILURE message includes the Time To Wait IE the MCE shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the M3 setup towards the same MME.
8.7.4	Abnormal Conditions
Void
8.8	MCE Configuration Update
8.8.1	General
The purpose of the MCE Configuration Update procedure is to update application level configuration data needed for the MCE and MME to interoperate correctly on the M3 interface.
The procedure uses non MBMS-service-associated signalling.
8.8.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.8.2-1: MCE Configuration Update procedure. Successful operation.
The MCE initiates the procedure by sending an MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the MME including an appropriate set of updated configuration data that it has just taken into operational use. The MME responds with MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to acknowledge that it successfully updated the configuration data. If information element(s) is/are not included in the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MME shall interpret that the corresponding configuration data is/are not changed and shall continue to operate the M3 with the existing related configuration data.
If the served MBMS Service Areas are to be updated, the complete set of supported MBMS Service Area Identities shall be included in the MBMS Service Area List IE.
If the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the MCE Name IE, the MME may use this IE as a human readable name of the MCE.
The updated configuration data shall be stored in both the MCE and the MME and used for the duration of the TNL association or until any further update is triggered by the MCE.
The MCE may initiate a further MCE Configuration Update procedure only after a previous MCE Configuration Update procedure has been completed.
8.8.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.8.3-1: MCE Configuration Update procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the MME cannot accept the update, it shall respond with an MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.
If the MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message includes the Time To Wait IE, the MCE shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the MCE Configuration Update procedure towards the MME. Both nodes shall continue to operate the M3 interface with their respective configuration data.
8.8.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the MCE after initiating the MCE Configuration Update procedure receives neither an MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE nor an MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message, the MCE may reinitiate a further MCE Configuration Update procedure towards the same MME, provided that the content of the new MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged MCE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.

9.2	Information Element Definitions
9.2.0	General
Subclause 9.2 presents the M3AP IE definitions in tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.3. In case there is contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table. In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the related capability is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause values indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.
Radio Network Layer cause
Meaning
Unknown or already allocated MCE MBMS M3AP ID
The action failed because the MCE MBMS M3AP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the MCE) is known and already allocated to an existing MBMS service related context.
Unknown or already allocated MME MBMS M3AP ID
The action failed because the MME MBMS M3AP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the MCE) is known and already allocated to an existing context.
Unknown or inconsistent pair of MBMS M3AP IDs
The action failed because both MBMS M3AP IDs are unknown, or are known but do not define a single MBMS context.
Radio resources not available
No requested radio resources are available.
Invalid QoS combination
The action was failed because of invalid QoS combination. 
Interaction with other procedure
The action is due to an ongoing interaction with another procedure.
Not supported QCI Value
The E-RAB setup failed because the requested QCI is not supported.
Unspecified
Sent for radio network layer cause when none of the specified cause values applies.
Un-involved MCE
The action failed because the MCE is not part of the involved MBSFN area when using MBSFN, or of the involved cell when using SC-PTM.

Transport Layer cause
Meaning
Transport Resource Unavailable
The required transport resources are not available.
Unspecified
Sent for transport network layer cause when none of the specified cause values applies.

NAS cause
Meaning
Unspecified
Sent for NAS cause when none of the specified cause values applies.

Meaning
Transfer Syntax Error
The received message included a transfer syntax error.
Abstract Syntax Error (Reject)
The received message included an abstract syntax error and the concerning criticality indicated "reject".
Abstract Syntax Error (Ignore And Notify)
The received message included an abstract syntax error and the concerning criticality indicated "ignore and notify".
Message Not Compatible With Receiver State
The received message was not compatible with the receiver state.
Semantic Error
The received message included a semantic error.
Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)
The received message contained IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.1	General
M3AP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.691 [4] and ITU-T Rec. X.680 [5].
Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the M3AP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of M3AP messages. M3AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct a M3AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules (Note that in the following IE means an IE in the object set with an explicit id. If one IE needed to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
If a M3AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
9.3.2	Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor inter-operability.
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.
