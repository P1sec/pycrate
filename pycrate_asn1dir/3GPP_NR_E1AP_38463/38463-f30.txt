1	Scope
The present document specifies the 5G radio network layer signalling protocol for the E1 interface. The E1 interface provides means for interconnecting a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP of a gNB within an NG-RAN, or for interconnecting a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP of an en-gNB within an E-UTRAN. The E1 Application Protocol (E1AP) supports the functions of E1 interface by signalling procedures defined in the present document. E1AP is developed in accordance to the general principles stated in TS 38.401 [2] and TS 38.460 [3].

3	Definitions and abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
Elementary Procedure: E1AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as standalone procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of several E1AP EPs together is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g., TS 38.460 [3]).
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
-	On time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
-	One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined for successful outcome.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
gNB: as defined in TS 38.300 [4].
gNB-CU: as defined in TS 38.401 [2].
gNB-DU: as defined in TS 38.401 [2].
gNB-CU-CP: as defined in TS 38.401 [2].
gNB-CU-UP: as defined in TS 38.401 [2].
PDU Session Resource: as defined in TS 38.401 [2].
UE-associated signalling: When E1AP messages associated to one UE uses the UE-associated logical E1-connection for association of the message to the UE in gNB-CU-UP and gNB-CU-CP.
UE-associated logical E1-connection: The UE-associated logical E1-connection uses the identities GNB-CU-CP UE E1AP ID and GNB-CU-UP UE E1AP ID according to the definition in TS 38.401 [2]. For a received UE associated E1AP message the gNB-CU-CP identifies the associated UE based on the GNB-CU-CP UE E1AP ID IE and the gNB-CU-UP identifies the associated UE based on the GNB-CU-UP UE E1AP ID IE.
3.2	Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply.

4	General
4.1	Procedure specification principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed.
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed.
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see clause 10.
4.2	Forwards and backwards compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g. Handover Preparation procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. E-RAB ID IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in the specification enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Value".
5	E1AP services
E1AP provides the signalling service between the gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP that is required to fulfil the E1AP functions described in clause 7. E1AP services are divided into two groups:
Non UE-associated services:	They are related to the whole E1 interface instance between the gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP utilising a non UE-associated signalling connection.
UE-associated services:	They are related to one UE. E1AP functions that provide these services are associated with a UE-associated signalling connection that is maintained for the UE in question.
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any instance in time one protocol endpoint shall have a maximum of one ongoing E1AP procedure related to a certain UE.
6	Services expected from signalling transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of E1AP messages. E1AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
7	Functions of E1AP
The functions of E1AP are described in TS 38.460 [3].
8	E1AP procedures
8.1	List of E1AP Elementary Procedures

8.2	Interface Management procedures
8.2.1	Reset
8.2.1.1	General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the E1AP UE-related contexts, in the event of a failure in the gNB-CU-CP or gNB-CU-UP. This procedure does not affect the application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the E1 Setup procedure.
The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
8.2.1.2	Successful Operation
8.2.1.2.1	Reset Procedure Initiated from the gNB-CU-CP

Figure 8.2.1.2.1-1: Reset procedure initiated from the gNB-CU-CP. Successful operation.
In the event of a failure at the gNB-CU-CP, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the gNB-CU-UP.
At reception of the RESET message the gNB-CU-UP shall release all allocated resources on E1 related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the indicated bearer contexts including E1AP ID.
After the gNB-CU-UP has released all assigned E1 resources and the UE E1AP IDs for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new UE-associated logical E1-connections over the E1 interface, the gNB-CU-UP shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The gNB-CU-UP does not need to wait for the release of bearer resources to be completed before returning the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical E1-connection list IE, then:
-	The gNB-CU-UP shall use the gNB-CU-CP UE E1AP ID IE and/or the gNB-CU-UP UE E1AP ID IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.
-	The gNB-CU-UP shall include in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each UE association to be reset, the UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IE in the UE-associated logical E1-connection list IE. The UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IEs shall be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical E1-connections. Empty UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the gNB-CU-CP UE E1AP ID IE is included in the UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-CU-UP shall include the gNB-CU-CP UE E1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the gNB-CU-UP UE E1AP ID IE is included in the UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-CU-UP shall include the gNB-CU-UP UE E1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

8.2.1.2.2	Reset Procedure Initiated from the gNB-CU-UP

Figure 8.2.1.2.2-1: Reset procedure initiated from the gNB-CU-UP. Successful operation.
In the event of a failure at the gNB-CU-UP, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the gNB-CU-CP.
At reception of the RESET message the gNB-CU-CP shall release all allocated resources on E1 related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the E1AP ID for the indicated UE associations.
After the gNB-CU-CP has released all assigned E1 resources and the UE E1AP IDs for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new UE-associated logical E1-connections over the E1 interface, the gNB-CU-CP shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The gNB-CU-CP does not need to wait for the release of bearer resources to be completed before returning the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical E1-connection list IE, then:
-	The gNB-CU-CP shall use the gNB-CU-CP UE E1AP ID IE and/or the gNB-CU-UP UE E1AP ID IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.
-	The gNB-CU-CP shall in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message include, for each UE association to be reset, the UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IE in the UE-associated logical E1-connection list IE. The UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IEs shall be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical E1-connections. Empty UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the gNB-CU-CP UE E1AP ID IE is included in the UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-CU-CP shall include the gNB-CU-CP UE E1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical E1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

Not applicable.
8.2.3	gNB-CU-UP E1 Setup
8.2.3.1	General
The purpose of the gNB-CU-UP E1 Setup procedure is to exchange application level data needed for the gNB-CU-UP and the gNB-CU-CP to correctly interoperate on the E1 interface. If the gNB-CU-UP initiates the first TNL association, it shall also initiate the gNB-CU-UP E1 Setup procedure. The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data in the two nodes and replaces it by the one received. This procedure also re-initialises the E1AP UE-related contexts (if any) and erases all related signalling connections in the two nodes like a Reset procedure would do. 
8.2.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.3.2-1: gNB-CU-UP E1 Setup procedure: Successful Operation.
The gNB-CU-UP initiates the procedure by sending a GNB-CU-UP E1 SETUP REQUEST message including the appropriate data to the gNB-CU-CP. The gNB-CU-CP responds with a GNB-CU-UP E1 SETUP RESPONSE message including the appropriate data. 
If the GNB-CU-UP E1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the gNB-CU-UP Name IE the gNB-CU-CP may use this IE as a human readable name of the gNB-CU-UP.
If the Slice Support List IE is contained in the GNB-CU-UP E1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU-CP shall store the corresponding information and it may take it into account for bearer context establishment.
If the NR CGI Support List IE is contained in the GNB-CU-UP E1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU-CP shall store the corresponding information and it may take it into account for bearer context establishment. 
If the QoS Parameters Support List IE is contained in the GNB-CU-UP E1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU-CP shall store the corresponding information and it may take it into account for bearer context establishment. 
The exchanged data shall be stored in respective node and used as long as there is an operational TNL association. When this procedure is finished, the E1 interface is operational and other E1 messages can be exchanged.
If the gNB-CU-UP Capacity IE is contained in the GNB-CU-UP E1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU-CP shall take this IE into account.

9	Elements for E1AP communication
9.1	General
Subclauses 9.2 and 9.3 present the E1AP message and IE definitions in tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.4. In case there is contradiction between the tabular format and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional IEs, where the tabular format shall take precedence. 
The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified in TR 25.921 [5].
When specifying IEs which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;
The following attributes are used for the tabular description of the messages and information elements: Presence, Range Criticality and Assigned Criticality. Their definition and use can be found in TS 38.413 [6].

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table. In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the related capability is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause values indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.
Radio Network Layer cause
Meaning
Unspecified
Sent for radio network layer cause when none of the specified cause values applies.
Unknown or already allocated gNB-CU-CP UE E1AP ID
The action failed because the gNB-CU-CP UE E1AP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the gNB-CU) is known and already allocated to an existing context.
Unknown or already allocated gNB-CU-UP UE E1AP ID
The action failed because the gNB-CU-UP UE E1AP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the gNB-CU-UP) is known and already allocated to an existing context.
Unknown or inconsistent pair of UE E1AP ID
The action failed because both UE E1AP IDs are unknown, or are known but do not define a single UE context.
Interaction with other procedure
The action is due to an ongoing interaction with another procedure.
PDCP COUNT wrap around
PDCP COUNT approaches the maximum value.
Not supported QCI value
The action failed because the requested QCI is not supported.
Not supported 5QI value
The action failed because the requested 5QI is not supported.
Encryption algorithms not supported 

The gNB-CU-UP is unable to support the selected encryption algorithm for the UE.
Integrity protection algorithms not supported
The gNB-CU-UP is unable to support the selected integrity protection algorithm for the UE.
UP integrity protection not possible 

The PDU Session cannot be accepted according to the required user plane integrity protection policy.
UP confidentiality protection not possible
The PDU Session cannot be accepted according to the required user plane confidentiality protection policy
Multiple PDU Session ID Instances
The action failed because multiple instances of the same PDU Session had been provided.
Unknown PDU Session ID
The action failed because the PDU Session ID is unknown.
Multiple QoS Flow ID Instances
The action failed because multiple instances of the same QoS flow had been provided.
Unknown QoS Flow ID
The action failed because the QoS Flow ID is unknow.
Multiple DRB ID Instances
The action failed because multiple instances of the same DRB had been provided.
Unknown DRB ID
The action failed because the DRB ID is unknow.
Invalid QoS combination
The action was failed because of invalid QoS combination
Procedure cancelled

The sending node cancelled the procedure due to other urgent actions to be performed.
Normal release

The action is due to a normal release of the UE (e.g. because of mobility) and does not indicate an error.
No radio resources available
The requested node doesn’t have sufficient radio resources available.
Action desirable for radio reasons
The reason for requesting the action is radio related.
Resources not available for the slice
The requested resources are not available for the slice.
PDCP configuration not supported,
The gNB-CU-UP is unable to support the selected PDCP configuration for the UE.
UE DL maximum integrity protected data rate reason
The request is not accepted in order to comply with the maximum downlink data rate for integrity protection supported by the UE.
UP integrity protection failure
The gNB-CU-UP detects an integrity protection failure in the UL PDU.
Release due to Pre-Emption
Release is initiated due to pre-emption.

Transport Layer cause
Meaning
Unspecified
Sent when none of the above cause values applies but still the cause is Transport Network Layer related.
Transport Resource Unavailable
The required transport resources are not available.

Protocol cause
Meaning
Transfer Syntax Error
The received message included a transfer syntax error.
Abstract Syntax Error (Reject)

9.4	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.4.1	General
E1AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.691 [7], ITU-T Rec. X.680 [8] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [9].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of E1AP messages. E1AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct an E1AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE:	In the above “IE” means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences will have different IE IDs.
If an E1AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
9.4.2	Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e., the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor interoperability;
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g., to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.

9.5	Message Transfer Syntax
E1AP shall use the ASN.1 Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER) Aligned Variant as transfer syntax, as specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.691 [7].
9.6	Timers
10	Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
Section 10 of TS 38.413 [6] is applicable for the purposes of the present document, with the following additions for non-UE-associated procedures: 
-	In case of Abstract Syntax Error, when reporting the Criticality Diagnostics IE for not comprehended IE/IEgroups or missing IE/IE groups, the Transaction ID IE shall also be included;
-	In case of Logical Error, when reporting the Criticality Diagnostics IE, the Transaction ID IE shall also be included;
- 	In case of Logical Error in a response message of a Class 1 procedure, or failure to comprehend Transaction ID IE from a received message, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated or not terminated (e.g., transaction ID unknown in response message), and local error handling shall be initiated.
