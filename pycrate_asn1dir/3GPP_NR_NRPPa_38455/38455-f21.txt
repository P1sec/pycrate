4	General
4.1	Procedure specification principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating NG-RAN Node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating NG-RAN Node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the initiating message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see section 10.
4.2	Forwards and backwards compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g. Handover Preparation procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. ERROR INDICATION message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. Cause IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in sub clause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Value".
5	NRPPa services
The present clause describes the services an NG -RAN Node offers to the LMF.
5.1	NRPPa procedure modules
The procedures are divided into two modules as follows:
1.	NRPPa Location Information Transfer Procedures;
2.	NRPPa Management Procedures;
The NRPPa Location Information Transfer Procedures module contains procedures used to handle the transfer of positioning related information between NG-RAN Node and LMF.
The Management Procedures module contains procedures that are not related specifically to positioning, i.e. error handling. 
5.2	Parallel transactions
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any instance in time one protocol peer may have more than one ongoing NRPPa procedure.
6	Services expected from lower layer
Within 5G RAN, NRPPa protocol uses the services provided by the NGAP protocol. An NRPPa message is carried inside an NGAP message.
NGAP signalling is described in TS 38.413 [2].
7	Functions of NRPPa
The NRPPa protocol provides the following functions:
-	E-CID Location Information Transfer. This function allows the NG-RAN node to exchange location information with LMF for the purpose of E-CID positioning.
-	OTDOA Information Transfer. This function allows the NG-RAN node to exchange information with the LMF for the purpose of OTDOA positioning.
-	Reporting of General Error Situations. This function allows reporting of general error situations, for which function specific error messages have not been defined.
The mapping between the above functions and NRPPa EPs is shown in the table below.

8.2	Location Information Transfer Procedures
8.2.1	E-CID Measurement Initiation
8.2.1.1	General
The purpose of E-CID Measurement Initiation procedure is to allow the LMF to request the NG-RAN node to report E-CID measurements used by LMF to compute the location of the UE.
8.2.1.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: E-CID Measurement Initiation procedure, successful operation
The LMF initiates the procedure by sending an E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message. If the NG-RAN node is able to initiate the requested E-CID measurements, it shall reply with the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.
The Measured Results IE shall be included in the E-CID Measurement Result IE of the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message when measurement results other than the "Cell-ID" have been requested.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "OnDemand", the NG-RAN node shall return the result of the measurement in the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message including, if available, the NG-RAN Access Point Position IE in the E-CID Measurement Result IE, and the LMF shall consider that the E-CID measurements for the UE has been terminated by the NG-RAN node. If available, the NG-RAN node shall include the Cell Portion ID IE in the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message. Upon reception of the Cell Portion ID IE, the LMF may use the value as the cell portion for the measurement. If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "OnDemand" and the Inter-RAT Measurement Quantities IE is included in the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, provide the corresponding measurements, if available in the NG-RAN node, in the Inter-RAT Measurement Result IE in E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message. If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "OnDemand" and the WLAN Measurement Quantities IE is included in the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, provide the corresponding measurements, if available in the NG-RAN node, in the WLAN Measurement Result IE in E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Periodic", the NG-RAN node shall initiate the requested measurements and shall reply with the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message without including either the E-CID Measurement Result IE or the Cell Portion ID IE in this message. The NG-RAN node shall then periodically initiate the E-CID Measurement Report procedure for the measurements, with the requested reporting periodicity.
8.2.1.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.3-1: E-CID Measurement Initiation procedure, unsuccessful operation
If the NG-RAN node is not able to initiate at least one of the requested E-CID measurements, the NG-RAN node shall respond with an E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION FAILURE message.
8.2.2	E-CID Measurement Failure Indication
8.2.2.1	General
The purpose of the E-CID Measurement Failure Indication procedure is for the NG-RAN node to notify the LMF that the E-CID measurements previously requested with the E-CID Measurement Initiation procedure can no longer be reported.
8.2.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2.2-1: E-CID Measurement Failure Indication, successful operation
Upon reception of the E-CID MEASUREMENT FAILURE INDICATION message, the LMF shall consider that the E-CID measurements for the UE have been terminated by the NG-RAN node.
8.2.2.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.2.3	E-CID Measurement Report
8.2.3.1	General
The purpose of E-CID Measurement Report procedure is for the NG-RAN node to provide the E-CID measurements for the UE to the LMF.
8.2.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.3.2-1: E-CID Measurement Report procedure, successful operation
The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending an E-CID MEASUREMENT REPORT message. The E-CID MEASUREMENT REPORT message contains the E-CID measurement results according to the measurement configuration in the respective E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message.
The Measured Results IE shall be included in the E-CID Measurement Result IE of the E-CID MEASUREMENT REPORT message when measurement results other than the "Cell-ID" have been requested.
If available, the NG-RAN node shall include the NG-RAN Access Point Position IE which is the configured estimated serving antenna position in the E-CID Measurement Result IE within the E-CID MEASUREMENT REPORT message. Upon reception of this NG-RAN Access Point Position IE, the LMF may use the value as the geographical position of the NG-RAN access point.
If available, the NG-RAN node shall include the Cell Portion ID IE in the E-CID MEASUREMENT REPORT message. Upon reception of the Cell Portion ID IE, the LMF may use the value as the cell portion for the measurement.
8.2.3.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.2.4	E-CID Measurement Termination
8.2.4.1	General
The purpose of E-CID Measurement Termination procedure is to terminate periodical E-CID measurements for the UE performed by the NG-RAN node.
8.2.4.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.4.2-1: E-CID Measurement Termination procedure, successful operation
The LMF initiates the procedure by generating an E-CID MEASUREMENT TERMINATION COMMAND message. 
8.2.4.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.2.5	OTDOA Information Exchange
8.2.5.1	General
The purpose of the OTDOA Information Exchange procedure is to allow the LMF to request the NG-RAN node to transfer OTDOA information to the LMF.
8.2.5.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.5.2-1: OTDOA Information Exchange procedure, successful operation
The LMF initiates the procedure by sending an OTDOA INFORMATION REQUEST message. The NG-RAN node responds with OTDOA INFORMATION RESPONSE message that contains the available OTDOA information applicable to the relevant cells/TPs.
8.2.5.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.2.5.3-1: OTDOA Information Exchange procedure, unsuccessful operation
If the NG-RAN node does not have any OTDOA information to report, the NG-RAN node shall respond with an OTDOA INFORMATION FAILURE message.
8.3	Management Procedures
8.3.1	Error Indication
8.3.1.1	General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node to report detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an appropriate failure message.
8.3.1.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.1.2-1: Error Indication procedure, LMF originated, successful operation

Figure 8.3.1.2-2: Error Indication procedure, NG-RAN node originated, successful operation
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE.
8.3.1.3	Abnormal Conditions 
Not applicable.

9.2	Information Element definitions
9.2.0	General
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.1	General
Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the NRPPa protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of NRPPa messages. NRPPa messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct an NRPPa message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules (Note that in the following, "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit id. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
If an NRPPa message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
9.3.2	Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor inter-operability.
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.
