1	Scope
The present document specifies the 5G radio network layer signalling protocol for the F1 interface. The F1 interface provides means for interconnecting a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU of a gNB within an NG-RAN, or for interconnecting a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU of an en-gNB within an E-UTRAN. The F1 Application Protocol (F1AP) supports the functions of F1 interface by signalling procedures defined in the present document. F1AP is developed in accordance to the general principles stated in TS 38.401 [4] and TS 38.470 [2].

3	Definitions and abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
elementary procedure: F1AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between gNB-CU and gNB-DU. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as standalone procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of several F1AP EPs together is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g., TS 38.470 [2]).
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
-	On time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
-	One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined for successful outcome.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
EN-DC operation: Used in this specification when the F1AP is applied for gNB-CU and gNB-DU in E-UTRAN.
gNB: as defined in TS 38.300 [6].
gNB-CU: as defined in TS 38.401 [4].
gNB-CU UE F1AP ID: as defined in TS 38.401 [4].
gNB-DU: as defined in TS 38.401 [4].
gNB-DU UE F1AP ID: as defined in TS 38.401 [4].
en-gNB: as defined in TS 37.340 [7].
UE-associated signalling: When F1AP messages associated to one UE uses the UE-associated logical F1-connection for association of the message to the UE in gNB-DU and gNB-CU.
UE-associated logical F1-connection: The UE-associated logical F1-connection uses the identities GNB-CU UE F1AP ID and GNB-DU UE F1AP ID according to the definition in TS 38.401 [4]. For a received UE associated F1AP message the gNB-CU identifies the associated UE based on the GNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE and the gNB-DU identifies the associated UE based on the GNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE. The UE-associated logical F1-connection may exist before the F1 UE context is setup in gNB-DU.

4	General
4.1	Procedure specification principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed.
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed.
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see clause 10.
4.2	Forwards and backwards compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g. Handover Preparation procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. E-RAB ID IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in the specification enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Value".

F1AP provides the signalling service between gNB-DU and the gNB-CU that is required to fulfil the F1AP functions described in clause 7. F1AP services are divided into two groups:
Non UE-associated services:	They are related to the whole F1 interface instance between the gNB-DU and gNB-CU utilising a non UE-associated signalling connection.
UE-associated services:	They are related to one UE. F1AP functions that provide these services are associated with a UE-associated signalling connection that is maintained for the UE in question.
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any instance in time one protocol endpoint shall have a maximum of one ongoing F1AP procedure related to a certain UE.
6	Services expected from signalling transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of F1AP messages. F1AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
7	Functions of F1AP
The functions of F1AP are described in TS 38.470 [2].

8.2	Interface Management procedures
8.2.1	Reset
8.2.1.1	General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the F1AP UE-related contexts, in the event of a failure in the gNB-CU or gNB-DU. This procedure does not affect the application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the F1 Setup procedure.
The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
8.2.1.2	Successful Operation
8.2.1.2.1	Reset Procedure Initiated from the gNB-CU

Figure 8.2.1.2.1-1: Reset procedure initiated from the gNB-CU. Successful operation
In the event of a failure at the gNB-CU, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the gNB-DU.
At reception of the RESET message the gNB-DU shall release all allocated resources on F1 and radio resources related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the indicated UE contexts including F1AP ID.
After the gNB-DU has released all assigned F1 resources and the UE F1AP IDs for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new UE-associated logical F1-connections over the F1 interface, the gNB-DU shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The gNB-DU does not need to wait for the release of radio resources to be completed before returning the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical F1-connection list IE, then:
-	The gNB-DU shall use the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE and/or the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.
-	The gNB-DU shall include in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each UE association to be reset, the UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the UE-associated logical F1-connection list IE. The UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IEs shall be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical F1-connections. Empty UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE is included in the UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-DU shall include the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE is included in the UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-DU shall include the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
Interactions with other procedures:
If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except for another Reset procedure) on the same F1 interface related to a UE association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be aborted.
8.2.1.2.2	Reset Procedure Initiated from the gNB-DU

In the event of a failure at the gNB-DU, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the gNB-CU.
At reception of the RESET message the gNB-CU shall release all allocated resources on F1 related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the F1AP ID for the indicated UE associations.
After the gNB-CU has released all assigned F1 resources and the UE F1AP IDs for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new UE-associated logical F1-connections over the F1 interface, the gNB-CU shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical F1-connection list IE, then:
-	The gNB-CU shall use the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE and/or the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.
-	The gNB-CU shall in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message include, for each UE association to be reset, the UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the UE-associated logical F1-connection list IE. The UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IEs shall be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical F1-connections. Empty UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE is included in the UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-CU shall include the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
-	If the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE is included in a UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-CU shall include the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

8.2.1.3	Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
8.2.2	Error Indication
8.2.2.1	General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node in order to report detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
8.2.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2.2-1: Error Indication procedure, gNB-CU originated. Successful operation


Figure 8.2.2.2-2: Error Indication procedure, gNB-DU originated. Successful operation
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE. In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by utilising UE associated signalling the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE and gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If one or both of the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE and the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE are not correct, the cause shall be set to appropriate value, e.g., "Unknown or already allocated gNB-CU UE F1AP ID", "Unknown or already allocated gNB-DU UE F1AP ID" or "Unknown or inconsistent pair of UE F1AP ID".
8.2.2.3	Abnormal Conditions 
Not applicable.
8.2.3	F1 Setup 
8.2.3.1	General
The purpose of the F1 Setup procedure is to exchange application level data needed for the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU to correctly interoperate on the F1 interface. This procedure shall be the first F1AP procedure triggered for the F1-C interface instance after a TNL association has become operational.
NOTE:	If F1-C signalling transport is shared among multiple F1-C interface instances, one F1 Setup procedure is issued per F1-C interface instance to be setup, i.e. several F1 Setup procedures may be issued via the same TNL association after that TNL association has become operational.
The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data in the two nodes and replaces it by the one received. This procedure also re-initialises the F1AP UE-related contexts (if any) and erases all related signalling connections in the two nodes like a Reset procedure would do. 
8.2.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.3.2-1: F1 Setup procedure: Successful Operation
The gNB-DU initiates the procedure by sending a F1 SETUP REQUEST message including the appropriate data to the gNB-CU. The gNB-CU responds with a F1 SETUP RESPONSE message including the appropriate data.
The exchanged data shall be stored in respective node and used as long as there is an operational TNL association. When this procedure is finished, the F1 interface is operational and other F1 messages may be exchanged.
If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the gNB-DU Name IE, the gNB-CU may use this IE as a human readable name of the gNB-DU.
If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the gNB-DU Served Cells List IE, the gNB-CU shall take into account as specified in TS 38.401 [4].
For NG-RAN, the gNB-DU shall include the gNB-DU System Information IE and the TAI Slice Support List IE.
The gNB-CU may include the Cells to be Activated List IE in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message. The Cells to be Activated List IE includes a list of cells that the gNB-CU requests the gNB-DU to activate. The gNB-DU shall activate the cells included in the Cells to be Activated List IE and reconfigure the physical cell identity for cells for which the NR PCI IE is included. 
For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU shall include the gNB-CU System Information IE in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message.
For NG-RAN, the gNB-DU may include the RAN Area Code IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message. The gNB-CU may use it according to TS 38.300 [6].
For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU may include Available PLMN List IE, and optionally also Extended Available PLMN List IE, if the available PLMN(s) are different from what gNB-DU has provided in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, gNB-DU shall take this into account and only broadcast the PLMN(s) included in the received Available PLMN list(s).
The Latest RRC Version Enhanced IE shall be included in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message and in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message.
If in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the Cell Direction IE is present, the gNB-CU should use it to understand whether the cell is for UL or DL only. If in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the Cell Direction IE is omitted in the Served Cell Information IE it shall be interpreted as that the Cell Direction is Bi-directional.
8.2.3.3	Unsuccessful Operation

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table. In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the related capability is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause values indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.
Radio Network Layer cause
Meaning
Unspecified
Sent for radio network layer cause when none of the specified cause values applies.
RL Failure-RLC
The action is due to an RL failure caused by exceeding the maximum number of ARQ retransmissions.
Unknown or already allocated gNB-CU UE F1AP ID
The action failed because the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the gNB-CU) is known and already allocated to an existing context.
Unknown or already allocated gNB-DU UE F1AP ID
The action failed because the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the gNB-DU) is known and already allocated to an existing context.
Unknown or inconsistent pair of UE F1AP ID
The action failed because both UE F1AP IDs are unknown, or are known but do not define a single UE context.
Interaction with other procedure
The action is due to an ongoing interaction with another procedure.
Not supported QCI Value
The action failed because the requested QCI is not supported.
Action Desirable for Radio Reasons
The reason for requesting the action is radio related.
No Radio Resources Available
The cell(s) in the requested node don’t have sufficient radio resources available.
Procedure cancelled
The sending node cancelled the procedure due to other urgent actions to be performed.
Normal Release
The action is due to a normal release of the UE (e.g. because of mobility) and does not indicate an error.
Cell Not Available
The action failed due to no cell available in the requested node.
RL Failure-others
The action is due to an RL failure caused by other radio link failures than exceeding the maximum number of ARQ retransmissions.
UE rejection
The action is due to gNB-CU’s rejection of a UE access request.
Resources not available for the slice
The requested resources are not available for the slice.
AMF initiated abnormal release
The release is triggered by an error in the AMF or in the NAS layer.
Release due to Pre-Emption
Release is initiated due to pre-emption.
PLMN not served by the gNB-CU
The PLMN indicated by the UE is not served by the gNB-CU.
Multiple DRB ID Instances
The action failed because multiple instances of the same DRB had been provided.
Unknown DRB ID
The action failed because the DRB ID is unknow.

Transport Layer cause
Meaning
Unspecified
Sent when none of the above cause values applies but still the cause is Transport Network Layer related.
Transport Resource Unavailable
The required transport resources are not available.

Protocol cause
Meaning
Transfer Syntax Error
The received message included a transfer syntax error.
Abstract Syntax Error (Reject)
The received message included an abstract syntax error and the concerning criticality indicated "reject".
Abstract Syntax Error (Ignore And Notify)
The received message included an abstract syntax error and the concerning criticality indicated "ignore and notify".
Message Not Compatible With Receiver State
The received message was not compatible with the receiver state.
Semantic Error
The received message included a semantic error.
Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)
The received message contained IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences.
Unspecified
Sent when none of the above cause values applies but still the cause is Protocol related.

Miscellaneous cause
Meaning
Control Processing Overload
Control processing overload.
Not Enough User Plane Processing Resources Available
No enough resources are available related to user plane processing.
Hardware Failure
Action related to hardware failure.
O&M Intervention
The action is due to O&M intervention.
Unspecified Failure
Sent when none of the above cause values applies and the cause is not related to any of the categories Radio Network Layer, Transport Network Layer or Protocol.

9.4	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.4.1	General
F1AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Recommendation X.691 [5], ITU-T Recommendation X.680 [12] and ITU-T Recommendation X.681 [13].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of F1AP messages. F1AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct an F1AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE:	In the above "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences will have different IE IDs.
If an F1AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
9.4.2	Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e., the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor interoperability;
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g., to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.
