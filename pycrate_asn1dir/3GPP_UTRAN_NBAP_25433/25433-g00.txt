3	Definitions, Symbols and Abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions apply.
CRNC Communication Context: The CRNC Communication Context contains the necessary information for the CRNC for communication with a specific UE. The CRNC Communication Context is identified by the CRNC Communication Context ID.
Elementary Procedure: The NBAP protocol consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between the CRNC and the Node B.
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message.
Two kinds of EPs are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success or failure).
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure has been successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful
-	A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
Node B Communication Context: The Node B Communication Context contains the necessary information for the Node B for communication with a specific UE. The Node B Communication Context is created by the Radio Link Setup procedure and deleted by the Radio Link Deletion procedure when deleting the last Radio Link within the Node B Communication Context. The Node B Communication Context is identified by the Node B Communication Context ID.
Prepared Reconfiguration: A Prepared Reconfiguration exists when the Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure has been completed successfully. The Prepared Reconfiguration does not exist anymore only after either of the procedures Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit or Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Cancellation has been completed. In particular, the Prepared Reconfiguration still exists if the object (e.g. Radio Link) concerned by the Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration (e.g. in the case of an HS-DSCH Setup) is removed, but the Node B Communication Context still exists.

4	General
4.1	Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the Node B exactly and completely. The CRNC functional behaviour is left unspecified. The Reset procedure is an exception from this principle.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in subclause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value. 
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality. 
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see section 10. For examples on how to use the Criticality Diagnostics IE, see Annex C.
4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a mechanism in which all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include Id and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.

5	NBAP Services
5.1	Parallel Transactions
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure description, at any instance in time one protocol peer shall have a maximum of one ongoing dedicated NBAP procedure related to a certain Node B Communication Context.
6	Services Expected from Signalling Transport
NBAP requires an assured in-sequence delivery service from the signalling bearer, and notification if the assured in-sequence delivery service is no longer available.
7	Functions of NBAP
The NBAP protocol provides the following functions:
-	Cell Configuration Management. This function gives the CRNC the possibility to manage the cell configuration information in a Node B.
-	Common Transport Channel Management. This function gives the CRNC the possibility to manage the configuration of Common Transport Channels in a Node B.

8	NBAP Procedures
8.1	Elementary Procedures
NBAP procedures are divided into common procedures and dedicated procedures.
-	NBAP common procedures are procedures that request initiation of a Node B Communication Context for a specific UE in Node B or are not related to a specific UE. NBAP common procedures also incorporate logical O&M (TS 25.401 [1]) procedures.
-	NBAP dedicated procedures are procedures that are related to a specific Node B Communication Context in Node B. This Node B Communication Context is identified by a Node B Communication Context identity.
The two types of procedures may be carried on separate signalling links.

If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message contains the Broadcast Reference IE in the FACH Parameters IE, and one or more established FACH common transport channels with the same Broadcast Reference, the same Transport Format Set, the same ToAWS and the same ToAWE exist (all of them in other distinct cells within the Node B), the Node B may include the Broadcast Common Transport Bearer Indication IE in the Common Transport Channel Information Response IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP RESPONSE message to inform the CRNC that the existing transport bearer, identified by Broadcast Common Transport Bearer Indication IE, shall be used instead of establishing a new transport bearer.
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message contains the Broadcast Reference IE in the FACH Parameters IE and no common transport channel with the same Broadcast Reference, the same Transport Format Set, the same ToAWS and the same ToAWE exists in another cell within the Node B, or if the Node B decides to establish a new transport bearer, the Node B may store the value of Broadcast Reference IE.
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message contains the IP Multicast Indication IE, and if supported, the Node B may join the indicated IP multicast group if it has not done so yet (IETF RFC 3376 [41] in case of IPv4, IETF RFC 3810 [42] in case of IPv6). If the Node B does join the IP multicast group, or is already joined to the IP multicast group as a result of a previous procedure, the Node B shall include the IP Multicast Data Bearer Indication IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL INFORMATION RESPONSE message to inform the CRNC that the existing IP multicast transport bearer, identified by IP Multicast Indication IE in the corresponding COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message, shall be used instead of using a IP unicast transport bearer. If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL INFORMATION RESPONSE message does not contain the IP Multicast Data Bearer Indication IE, the CRNC shall send FACH data frames on the IP unicast transport bearer. No matter whether the Node B has joined the indicated IP multicast group, a new transport bearer shall be established using the Transport Layer Address IE and Binding ID IE and FACH specific control frames, e.g. TIMING ADJUSTMENT, shall be sent on the established Iub transport bearer.
General:
After successfully configuring the requested common transport channels and the common physical channels, the Node B shall store the value of Configuration Generation ID IE and it shall respond with the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP RESPONSE message with the Common Transport Channel ID IE, the Binding ID IE (if no Broadcast Common Transport Bearer Indication IE is included or if no BCH Parameters IE is included) and the Transport Layer Address IE (if no Broadcast Common Transport Bearer Indication IE is included or if no BCH Parameters IE is included) for the configured common transport channels.
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message includes the Transport Layer Address and Binding ID IEs, the Node B may use the transport layer adress and the binding identifier received from the CRNC when establishing a transport bearer for the indicated common transport channels.
After a successful procedure and once the transport bearers are established, the configured common transport channels and the common physical channels shall adopt the state Enabled (TS 25.430 [6]) in the Node B and the common physical channels exist on the Uu interface.

If the Node B is not able to support all or part of the configuration, it shall reject the configuration of all the channels in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message. The channels in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message shall remain in the same state as prior to the procedure. The Cause IE shall be set to an appropriate value. The value of Configuration Generation ID IE from the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message shall not be stored.
If the configuration was unsuccessful, the Node B shall respond with a COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP FAILURE message.

8.2.16	System Information Update
8.2.16.1	General
The System Information Update procedure performs the necessary operations in order for the Node B to apply the correct scheduling of and/or to include the appropriate contents to the system information segments broadcast on the BCCH.
8.2.16.2	Successful Operation

Figure 22: System Information Update procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with a SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message sent from the CRNC to the Node B using the Node B Control Port.
The Node B shall consider the requested updates to the BCCH schedule in the same order as the MIB/SB/SIB information is included in the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message.
If the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message includes the BCCH Modification Time IE, the updates to the BCCH schedule (possibly consisting of IB occurrence additions, IB occurrence deletions and IB occurrence contents updates) indicated in the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message shall be applied by the Node B at the first time instance starting from the SFN value set by the BCCH Modification Time IE. If no BCCH Modification Time IE is included, the updates to the BCCH schedule shall be applied as soon as possible.
The Node B shall consider the requested updates to be the BCH mapped on SCCPCH if the BCH mapped on SCCPCH Indication IE is included in the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message.

If the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message contains Master Information Block (MIB) segments in addition to SIB or SB segments, the MIB segments shall first be sent in the physical channel by the Node B. Once these MIB segments have been sent in the physical channel, the updated SB/SIB segments shall then be sent in the physical channel.
Only if the inclusion of each new IB segment in the BCCH schedule leads to a valid segment combination according to TS 25.331 [18], the Node B shall accept the system information update.
If the SIB Originator IE value is set to "Node B", the Node B shall create the SIB segment of the SIB type given by the IB Type IE and autonomously update the SIB segment and apply the scheduling and repetition as given by the IB SG REP IE and IB SG POS IE.
SIBs originating from the Node B can only be SIBs containing information that the Node B can obtain on its own.
If the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message contains SB3 segment in addition to SIB, the BCH mapped on SCCPCH is used.

This rule shall apply even if the scheduling instructions in IB SG REP IE and IB SG POS IE were the same as the current scheduling instructions for the concerned IB;
-	If a MIB/SB/SIB Information IE repetition includes no IB SG REP IE and IB SG POS IE and there is no IB in the BCCH schedule with the same IB Type and IB OC ID;

8.2.17	Radio Link Setup
8.2.17.1	General
This procedure is used for establishing the necessary resources for a new Node B Communication Context in the Node B.
[FDD - The Radio Link Setup procedure is used to establish one or more radio links. The procedure establishes one or more DCHs on all radio links, and in addition, it can include the establishment of an HS-DSCH on one radio link and it can include the establishment of an E-DCH on one or more radio links.]
[TDD - The Radio Link Setup procedure is used to establish one radio link including one or more transport channels. The transport channels can be a mix of DCHs, DSCHs, and USCHs, or DCHs and an HS-DSCH, or DCHs, an HS-DSCH and an E-DCH, including also combinations where one or more transport channel types are not present.]

Transport Channels Handling:
DCH(s):
[TDD - If the DCH Information IE is present, the Node B shall configure the new DCH(s) according to the parameters given in the message.]
If the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message includes a DCH Information IE with multiple DCH Specific Info IEs, then the Node B shall treat the DCHs in the DCH Information IE as a set of co-ordinated DCHs. The Node B shall include these DCHs in the new configuration only if it can include all of them in the new configuration.
If the DCH Specific Info IE includes the Unidirectional DCH Indicator IE set to "Uplink DCH only", the Node B shall ignore the Transport Format Set IE for the downlink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the downlink CCTrCH.

If no Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH, the Physical channel BER shall be used for the QE, ref. TS 25.427 [16]. If the QE-Selector IE is set to "non-selected", the Physical channel BER shall be used for the QE in the UL data frames, ref. TS 25.427 [16].]

[FDD - If no Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH, the Physical channel BER shall be used for the QE, ref. TS 25.427 [16]. If all DCHs have QE-Selector IE set to "non-selected", the Physical channel BER shall be used for the QE, ref. TS 25.427 [16]].
The Node B shall use the included UL FP Mode IE for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs as the FP Mode in the Uplink of the user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the configuration.
The Node B shall use the included ToAWS IE for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs as the Time of Arrival Window Startpoint in the user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the configuration.
The Node B shall use the included ToAWE IE for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs as the Time of Arrival Window Endpoint in the user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the configuration.
The received Frame Handling Priority IE specified for each Transport Channel should be used when prioritising between different frames in the downlink on the radio interface in congestion situations within the Node B once the new RL(s) has been activated.
If the TNL QoS IE is included for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs and if ALCAP is not used, the TNL QoS IE may be used by the Node B to determine the transport bearer characteristics to apply in the uplink between the Node B and the CRNC for the related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs.
[FDD - The Diversity Control Field IE indicates for each RL (except the first RL in the message) whether the Node B shall combine the concerned RL or not.
-	If the Diversity Control Field IE is set to"May", the Node B shall decide for either of the alternatives.
-	If the Diversity Control Field IE is set to "Must", the Node B shall combine the RL with one of the other RL.

Upon reception, the Node B shall initiate the requested transmission according to the parameters given in the request and start the measurement on [3.84Mcps TDD - Cell Synchronisation Bursts] [1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL code] if requested.
[3.84Mcps TDD - Cell Sync Burst Transmission Initiation] [1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL Code Transmission Initiation LCR]:

8.2.21	Cell Synchronisation Reconfiguration [TDD]
8.2.21.1	General
This procedure is used by a CRNC to reconfigure the transmission of [3.84Mcps TDD - Cell Synchronisation Bursts] [1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL Code] and/or to reconfigure measurements on [3.84Mcps TDD - Cell Synchronisation Bursts] [1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL Code] in a Node B.
8.2.21.2	Successful Operation
8.2.21.2.1	General


Figure 27E Cell Synchronisation Reconfiguration procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with a CELL SYNCHRONISATION RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message sent from the CRNC to the Node B using the Node B Control Port.
Upon reception, the Node B shall reconfigure the [3.84Mcps TDD - Cell Synchronisation Burst] [1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL Code] transmission and/or measurements according to the parameters given in the request. 
8.2.21.2.2	[3.84Mcps TDD - Cell Sync Burst Schedule]
Within the CELL SYNCHRONISATION RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message first the schedule for the steady state phase is fixed. I.e. the number of cycles per SFN period is defined with the same schedule. For each cycle, the number of repetitions is defined according to following equations: 
Cycle length:	4096 / value of Number Of Cycles Per SFN Period IE
Repetition period:	Cycle length / value of Number Of Repetitions Per Cycle Period IE
Cell Sync Frame number is calculated by: 
SFN = floor((k-1) * Cycle length + (i-1)* Repetition period)
	k = {1, 2, 3, .. Number of cycle per SFN period}
	i = {1, 2, 3, .. Cell Sync Frame number within cycle period}
8.2.21.2.3	[1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL Code Schedule]
Within the CELL SYNCHRONISATION RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message first the schedule for the steady state phase is fixed. The "schedule" includes
-	the list of frame numbers SFN within the SFN period where SYNC_DL Code transmission or reception takes place, i.e. the "synchronisation frames", and
-	the associated actions (SYNC_DL Code transmission, reception, averaging, reporting etc) to be performed for synchronisation purpose by the Node B at each of these SFNs.
Within the synchronisation frames, only the first subframe shall be used for sending or receiving a SYNC_DL Code in the DwPTS while in the second subframe, normal operation continues.
The synchronisation schedule includes the option of averaging of measured correlation results within the Node B over a sequence of measurements, for increasing the reliability of the Time of Arrival measurement obtained from the correlation results. For this purpose, the concept of "subcycles" has been introduced: Each Synchronisation Cycle is devided into "subcycles" where in each subcycle, the same set of SYNC_DL transmissions and receptions is performed, and averaging takes place over all the subcycles within a Synchronisation Cycle. Since the list of actions (transmission, measurements etc) is the same in each subcycle, and the subcycles are repeated to make up a cycle, and the cycles make up an SFN period, the full list of actions is derived by the actions specified for a subcycle.
The full list of SFNs which make up the synchronisation schedule within the SFN period are calculated in Node B and CRNC autonomously based on the following parameters included in the CELL SYNCHRONISATION RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message: "Number of cycles per SFN period", "Number of subcycles per cycle period", and "Number of repetitions per cycles period", along the following equations:
Cycle length:	4096 / value of Number Of Cycles Per SFN Period IE
Subcycle length:	Cycle length / value of Number Of Subcycles Per Cycle Period IE
Repetition period:	Subcycle length / value of Number Of Repetitions Per Cycle Period IE
	SFN = floor((k-1) * Cycle length + (j-1)*Subcycle length + (i-1)* Repetition period)
	k = {1, 2, 3, .. Number of cycle per SFN period}
	j = {1, 2, 3, .. Number of subcycles per cycle}
	i = {1, 2, 3, .. Number of repetitions per cycle period}
Note that if the Number Of Subcycles Per Cycle IE is equal to 1, then the subcycles are identical to the "Synchronisation Cycles".
If the Number Of Subcycles Per Cycle IE is included in the CELL SYNCHRONISATION RECONFIGURATION REQUEST [TDD] message, then the Node B shall apply this number for dividing the Synchronisation Cycles in Subcycles. If the IE is not present, then the Node B shall assume that there is one subcycle per synchronisation cycle only, which is identical to the synchronisation cycle.
Averaging is performed as follows:
-	From each SYNC_DL code being received according to the schedule, the Node B shall calculate a "correlation function" by matching the received data with the respective expected code.
-	Therefore the set of measurements within one subcycle provides a set of "correlation functions".
-	The set of correlation functions of the first subcycle within a synchronisation cycle is stored in an averaging memory.
-	The sets of correlation functions of the subsequent subcycles within a synchronisation cycle are combined with the available contents of the "averaging memory", to produce an average over all the sets of correlation functions within a synchronisation cycle.
-	At the end of a synchronisation cycle, the Time-of-Arrival measurements for that synchronisation cycle are obtained by evaluating the final set of correlation functions.
These Time-of-Arrival measurements, together with associated SIR values obtained from the averaged correlation functions, are included in a Measurement Report to the CRNC, according to a measurement reporting plan.
In addition, the Time-of-Arrival measurements may optionally be used for autonomous self-adjustment of the timing of the respective cell.
8.2.21.2.4	[3.84Mcps TDD - Cell Sync Burst Transmission Reconfiguration] [1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL Code Transmission Reconfiguration]

During subsequent transmissions of the DwPCH which are for normal operation the power of the DwPCH shall assume its normal level.]

[1.28Mcps TDD - When the Propagation Delay Compensation IE is present in the SYNC_DL Code Measurement Information LCR, the Node B shall, if supported, perform the following functions: (1) use the respective SYNC_DL measurement (after potential averaging) to perform the self-adjustment of the respective cell’s timing at the end of a Synchronisation Cycle; (2) include the Accumulated Clock Update IE in the CELL SYNCHRONISATION REPORT message, to report the total accumulated amount of timing adjustments since the last report to the RNC. This Accumulated Clock Update value shall also include the adjustments which may have been performed by explicit order from the CRNC in the CELL SYNCHRONISATION ADJUSTMENT REQUEST message. The times for self-adjustment at the end of a synchronisation cycle shall be independent from the measurement reporting characteristics; the Accumulated Adjustment values shall be included in the CELL SYNCHRONISATION REPORT messages without influencing the frequency of measurement reporting.]
If the Synchronisation Report Type IE is provided, the measurement reporting shall apply according the parameter given in the message.

The Synchronisation Report Characteristics IE indicates how the reporting of the cell synchronisation burst measurement shall be performed.

8.3.6.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the RL indicated by the RL ID IE, Node B Communication Context ID IE and CRNC Communication Context ID IE does not exist, the Node B shall respond with the RADIO LINK DELETION RESPONSE message and use the CRNC Communication Context ID IE received in the RADIO LINK DELETION REQUEST message.
8.3.7	Downlink Power Control [FDD]
8.3.7.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to balance the DL transmission powers of one or more Radio Links used for the related UE-UTRAN connection within the Node B. The Downlink Power Control procedure may be initiated by the CRNC at any time when the Node B Communication Context exists, irrespective of other ongoing CRNC initiated dedicated NBAP procedures towards this Node B Communication Context. The only exception occurs when the CRNC has requested the deletion of the last RL via this Node B, in which case the Downlink Power Control procedure shall no longer be initiated.
8.3.7.2	Successful Operation

Figure 37: Downlink Power Control procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated by the CRNC sending a DL POWER CONTROL REQUEST message to the Node B using the Communication Control Port assigned to the concerned Node B Communication Context.
The Power Adjustment Type IE defines the characteristic of the power adjustment.
If the value of the Power Adjustment Type IE is "Common", the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the Node B Communication Context shall be set to "Common". As long as the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the Node B Communication Context is set to "Common", the Node B shall perform the power adjustment (see below) for all existing and future radio links associated with the context identified by the Node B Communication Context ID IE and use a common DL reference power level.
If the value of the Power Adjustment Type IE is "Individual", the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the Node B Communication Context shall be set to "Individual". The Node B shall perform the power adjustment (see below) for all radio links addressed in the message using the given DL Reference Powers per RL. If the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the Node B Communication Context was set to "Common" before this message was received, power balancing on all radio links not addressed by the DL POWER CONTROL REQUEST message shall remain to be executed in accordance with the existing power balancing parameters which are now considered RL individual parameters. Power balancing will not be started on future radio links without a specific request.
If the value of the Power Adjustment Type IE is "None", the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the Node B Communication Context shall be set to "None" and the Node B shall suspend on going power adjustments for all radio links for the Node B Communication Context.
If the Inner Loop DL PC Status IE is present and set to "Active", the Node B shall activate inner loop DL power control for all radio links for the Node B Communication Context. If the Inner Loop DL PC Status IE is present and set to "Inactive", the Node B shall deactivate inner loop DL power control for all radio links for the Node B Communication Context according to ref. TS 25.214 [10].
Power Adjustment
The power balancing adjustment shall be superimposed on the inner loop power control adjustment (see ref. TS 25.214 [10]) if activated. The power balancing adjustment shall be such that:
 with an accuracy of ±0.5 dB
where the sum is performed over an adjustment period corresponding to a number of frames equal to the value of the Adjustment Period IE, Pref is the value of the DL Reference Power IE, PP-CPICH is the power used on the primary CPICH, Pinit is the code power of the last slot of the previous adjustment period and r is given by the Adjustment Ratio IE. If the last slot of the previous adjustment period is within a transmission gap due to compressed mode, Pinit shall be set to the same value as the code power of the slot just before the transmission gap.
The adjustment within one adjustment period shall in any case be performed with the constraints given by the Max Adjustment Step IE and the DL TX power range set by the CRNC.
The power adjustments shall be started at the first slot of a frame with CFN modulo the value of Adjustment Period IE equal to 0 and shall be repeated for every adjustment period and shall be restarted at the first slot of a frame with CFN=0, until a new DL POWER CONTROL REQUEST message is received or the RL is deleted.

8.3.8.1	General
This procedure is used by a CRNC to request the initiation of measurements on dedicated resources in a Node B.
The Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure shall not be initiated if a Prepared Reconfiguration exists, as defined in subclause 3.1 except when the Node B Communication Context ID IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message is set to the reserved value "All NBCC".
If the Node B Communication Context ID IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message is set to the reserved value "All NBCC", the Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure may be initiated by the CRNC at any time when the Node B Communication Context exists.
8.3.8.2	Successful Operation

Figure 38: Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with a DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message sent from the CRNC to the Node B using the Communication Control Port assigned to the Node B Communication Context.
Upon reception, the Node B shall initiate the requested measurement according to the parameters given in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message. Unless specified below the meaning of the parameters are given in other specifications.
If the Node B Communication Context ID IE equals the reserved value "All NBCC", this measurement request shall apply for all current and future Node B Communication Contexts controlled via the Communication Control Port on which the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message was received. Otherwise, this measurement request shall apply for the requested Node B Communication Context ID only.
If the Node B Communication Context ID IE equals the reserved value "All NBCC", the measurement request shall be treated as a single measurement, despite applying to multiple contexts. This means that it may only be terminated or failed on "All NBCC".
If the Node B Communication Context ID IE equals the reserved value "All NBCC", the measurement shall be initiated only for those Node B Communication Contexts handling a mode (FDD, 3.84Mcps TDD, 7.68Mcps TDD or 1.28Mcps TDD) for which the concerned measurement is specified in TS 25.215 [4] and TS 25.225 [5]. The initiation of the measurement for a Node B Communication Context may be delayed until the Reconfiguration CFN has elapsed if either a Prepared Reconfiguration exists or a Prepared Reconfiguration no longer exists but the Reconfiguration CFN has not yet elapsed.
If the Dedicated Measurement Object Type is indicated as being "RL" in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, measurement results shall be reported for all indicated Radio Links.

[FDD - If the Dedicated Measurement Object Type is indicated as being "ALL RLS" in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, measurement results shall be reported for all existing and future Radio Link Sets within the Node B Communication Context.]
[TDD - If the DPCH ID IE or DPCH ID 7.68Mcps IE is provided within the RL Information, the measurement request shall apply for the requested physical channel individually. If no DPCH ID IE, HS-SICH ID IE, DPCH ID 7.68Mcps IE and no PUSCH Information IE is provided within the RL Information, the measurement request shall apply for one existing physical channel per CCTrCH in each used time slot of the Radio Link, provided the measurement type is applicable to this physical channel.]
[TDD - If the PUSCH Information IE is provided within the RL Information, the measurement request shall apply for the requested physical channel individually.]
[TDD - If the HS-SICH Information IE is provided within the RL Information, the measurement request shall apply for the requested physical channel individually.] 
[TDD - If the Dedicated Measurement Type IE is set to "HS-SICH reception quality ", the Node B shall initiate measurements of the failed, missed and total HS-SICH transmissions on all of the HS-SICH assigned to this Node B Communication Context. If either the failed or missed HS-SICH transmission satisfies the requested report characteristics, the Node B shall report the result of both failed and missed transmission measurements along with the total number of transmissions.]
If the CFN Reporting Indicator IE is set to "FN Reporting Required", the CFN IE shall be included in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT message or in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message, the latter only in the case the Report Characteristics IE is set to "On Demand". The reported CFN shall be the CFN at the time when the measurement value was reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement model (TS 25.302 [25]).
[FDD - If the Number Of Reported Cell Portions IE is included in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the value shall be used to determine how many Cell Portion ID IEs and SIR Value IEs shall be included in Best Cell Portions IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT message or in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.] 
[1.28Mcps TDD - If the Number Of Reported Cell Portions LCR IE is included in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the value shall be used to determine how many Cell Portion LCR ID IEs and RSCP Value IEs shall be included in Best Cell Portions LCR IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT message or in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.

Report characteristics 
The Report Characteristics IE indicates how the reporting of the measurement shall be performed. See also Annex B.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "On Demand" and if the CFN IE is not provided, the Node B shall return the result of the measurement immediately. If the CFN IE is provided, it indicates the frame for which the measurement value shall be provided. The provided measurement value shall be the one reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement model (TS 25.302 [25]).
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Periodic", the Node B shall periodically initiate the Dedicated Measurement Report procedure for this measurement, with the requested report frequency. If the CFN IE is provided, it indicates the frame for which the first measurement value of a periodic reporting shall be provided. The provided measurement value shall be the one reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement model (TS 25.302 [25]).
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event A", the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity rises above the requested threshold and stays there for the requested hysteresis time. If the Measurement Hysteresis Time IE is not included, the Node B shall use the value zero for the hysteresis time.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event B", the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity falls below the requested threshold and stays there for the requested hysteresis time. If the Measurement Hysteresis Time IE is not included, the Node B shall use the value zero for the hysteresis time.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event C", the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity rises by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the requested time. After having reported this type of event, the next C event reporting for the same measurement cannot be initiated before the rising time specified by the Measurement Change Time IE has elapsed since the previous event reporting.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event D", the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity falls by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the requested time. After having reported this type of event, the next D event reporting for the same measurement cannot be initiated before the falling time specified by the Measurement Change Time IE has elapsed since the previous event reporting.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event E", the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity rises above the 'Measurement Threshold 1' and stays there for the 'Measurement Hysteresis Time' (Report A). When the conditions for Report A are met and the Report Periodicity IE is provided, the Node B shall also initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure periodically. If the conditions for Report A have been met and the measured entity falls below the 'Measurement Threshold 2' and stays there for the 'Measurement Hysteresis Time', the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) as well as terminate any corresponding periodic reporting. If the Measurement Threshold 2 IE is not present, the Node B shall use the value of the Measurement Threshold 1 IE instead. If the Measurement Hysteresis Time IE is not included, the Node B shall use the value zero as hysteresis times for both Report A and Report B.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event F", the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity falls below the 'Measurement Threshold 1' and stays there for the 'Measurement Hysteresis Time' (Report A). When the conditions for Report A are met and the Report Periodicity IE is provided, the Node B shall also initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure periodically. If the conditions for Report A have been met and the measured entity rises above the 'Measurement Threshold 2' and stays there for the 'Measurement Hysteresis Time', the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) as well as terminate any corresponding periodic reporting. If the Measurement Threshold 2 IE is not present, the Node B shall use the value of the Measurement Threshold 1 IE instead. If the Measurement Hysteresis Time IE is not included, the Node B shall use the value zero as hysteresis times for both Report A and Report B.
If the Report Characteristics IE is set to "On Modification" and if the SFN IE is not provided, the Node B shall report the result of the requested measurement immediately. If the SFN IE is provided, it indicates the frame for which the measurement value shall be provided. Then, the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure in accordance to the following conditions:
1.	If the Dedicated Measurement Type IE is set to "Best Cell Portions LCR":
-	The Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the Dedicated Measurement Value "Best Cell Portions LCR" changes.
If the Report Characteristics IE is not set to "On Demand", the Node B is required to perform reporting for a dedicated measurement object, in accordance with the conditions provided in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, as long as the object exists. If no dedicated measurement object for which a measurement is defined exists anymore, the Node B shall terminate the measurement locally, i.e. without reporting this to the CRNC.
If at the start of the measurement, the reporting criteria are fulfilled for any of Event A, Event B, Event E or Event F, the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure immediately, and then continue with the measurements as specified in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message.
Higher layer filtering 
The Measurement Filter Coefficient IE indicates how filtering of the measurement values shall be performed before measurement event evaluation and reporting.
The averaging shall be performed according to the following formula.
	
The variables in the formula are defined as follows
Fn is the updated filtered measurement result
Fn-1 is the old filtered measurement result
	Mn is the latest received measurement result from physical layer measurements, the unit used for Mn is the same unit as the reported unit in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE, DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT messages or the unit used in the event evaluation (i.e. same unit as for Fn)
a = 1/2(k/2) , where k is the parameter received in the Measurement Filter Coefficient IE. If the Measurement Filter Coefficient IE is not present, a shall be set to 1 (no filtering)
In order to initialise the averaging filter, F0 is set to M1 when the first measurement result from the physical layer measurement is received.
Measurement Recovery Behavior:
If the Measurement Recovery Behavior IE is included in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the Node B shall, if Measurement Recovery Behavior is supported, include the Measurement Recovery Support Indicator IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message and perform the Measurement Recovery Behavior as described in subclause 8.3.9.2.
Response message
If the Node B was able to initiate the measurement requested by the CRNC, it shall respond with the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message using the Communication Control Port assigned to the Node B Communication Context. The message shall include the same Measurement ID that was used in the measurement request. The DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message shall be sent even if the initiation is delayed for some Node B Communication Contexts due to an existing Prepared Reconfiguration or that the Reconfiguration CFN has not yet elapsed.
Only in the case where the Report Characteristics IE is set to "On Demand", the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message shall include the Dedicated Measurement Object Type IE containing the measurement result. [TDD - In the case that the measurement was performed on a particular HS-SICH, the Node B shall include the HS-SICH ID IE that indicates which HS-SICH was measured.]

9.2	Information Element Functional Definition and Contents
9.2.0	General
Subclause 9.2 presents the NBAP IE definitions in tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in Subclause 9.3. In case there is a contradiction between the tabular format in Subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

9.2.1.9A	Common Channels Capacity Consumption Law
The capacity consumption law indicates to the CRNC how the Capacity Credit is consumed by NBAP set of procedures, depending on the allocated Spreading Factor. [FDD - For the PRACH, the reference spreading factor shall be the minimum possible spreading factor amongst the ones defined by the RACH Slot Format IE(s) in the Common Transport Channel Setup or Reconfiguration procedures.]
This capacity consumption law indicates the consumption law to be used with the following procedures:
-	Common Transport Channel Setup
-	Common Transport Channel Deletion
-	[FDD - Common Transport Channel Reconfiguration]
For the Common Transport Channel Setup procedure, the cost given in the consumption law shall be debited from the Capacity Credit, whereas it shall be credited to the Capacity Credit for the Common Transport Channel Deletion one.
[FDD - For the Common Transport Channel Reconfiguration procedure, the difference of the consumption cost for the new spreading factor and the consumption cost for the old spreading factor shall be debited from the Capacity Credit (or credited if this difference is negative).]
If the modelling of the internal resource capability of the Node B is modelled independently for the Uplink and Downlink, the "DL cost" shall be applied to the "DL or Global Capacity Credit" and the "UL Cost" shall be applied to the "UL Capacity Credit". If it is modelled as shared resources, both the "DL cost" and the "UL cost" shall be applied to the "DL or Global Capacity Credit".
[FDD - When the Common Transport Channel Setup, Deletion or Reconfiguration procedures are used, the Capacity Credit shall be updated considering all physical channels related in these procedures (S-CCPCH, PICH, PRACH and AICH), i.e. one cost shall be credited to or debited from the Capacity Credit per physical channel.] 
[FDD - The costs given in the consumption law are the costs per channelization code. When multiple channelization codes are used by a physical channel, the cost credited to or debited from the Capacity Credit for this physical channel shall be taken as N times the cost given in the consumption law, where N is the number of channelization codes.]
[TDD - When the Common Transport Channel Setup or Deletion procedures are used, the Capacity Credit shall be updated considering all physical channels related in these procedures (S-CCPCH, PICH, PRACH), i.e. one cost shall be credited to or debited from the Capacity Credit per physical channel.]

9.2.1.20A	Dedicated Channels Capacity Consumption Law
The capacity consumption law indicates to the CRNC how the Capacity Credit is consumed by NBAP set of procedures, depending on the [FDD - allocated Spreading Factor and the RL/RLS situation] [TDD - allocated Spreading Factor on each DPCH and the assigned timeslot]. [FDD - In Uplink, the reference spreading factor shall be the minimum spreading factor signalled in the Radio Link Setup Request message. This is signalled using the Min UL Channelisation Code Length IE.]
This capacity consumption law indicates the consumption law to be used with the following procedures :
-	Radio Link Setup
-	Radio Link Addition
-	Radio Link Reconfiguration
-	Radio Link Deletion
-	[TDD - Physical Shared Channel Reconfiguration]
For the Radio Link Setup and Radio Link Addition procedures, the cost given in the consumption law shall be debited from the Capacity Credit, whereas it shall credited to the Capacity Credit for the Radio Link Deletion procedure. For the Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure, the difference of the consumption cost for the new spreading factor and the consumption cost for the old spreading factor shall be debited from the Capacity Credit (or credited when this difference is negative).
If the modelling of the internal resource capability of the Node B is modelled independently for the Uplink and Downlink, the DL cost shall be applied to the DL or Global Capacity Credit and the UL Cost shall be applied to the UL Capacity Credit. If it is modelled as shared resources, both the DL costs and the UL costs shall be applied to the DL or Global Capacity Credit.
[FDD - For a Radio Link creating a Radio Link Set (first RL of a RLS), the cost for the RL (cost 2) and RLS (cost 1) shall be taken into account. When adding a Radio Link to a Radio Link Set, only the RL cost (cost 2) shall be taken into account.
In the case where multiple Radio Links are established in one procedure, for every created Radio Link Set, the first Radio Link is always the Radio Link with the lowest repetition number.]
[FDD - The costs given in the consumption law are the costs per channelization code. When multiple channelization codes are used by either the radio links, the cost credited to or debited from the Capacity Credit shall be taken as N times the cost for one code, where N is the number of channelization codes.]
[TDD - The cost for a radio link is a sum of the costs for each DPCH. For the first DPCH assigned to any user in a cell within a timeslot, the initial cost for a DPCH in a timeslot (cost 1) and the cost for a DPCH (cost 2) shall be taken into account. For any DPCH that is not the first DPCH assigned for any user in a cell within a timeslot, only the cost for a DPCH (cost 2) shall be taken into account.]
[TDD - The cost for shared channels is the sum of the costs for each PDSCH and PUSCH assigned to a PUSCH or PDSCH set. For the first PDSCH or PUSCH assigned to any user in a cell within a timeslot, the initial cost for a PDSCH/PUSCH in a timeslot (cost 1) and the cost for a PDSCH/PUSCH (cost 2) shall be taken into account. For any PDSCH/PUSCH that is not the first PDSCH/PUSCH assigned to any user in a cell within a timeslot, only the cost for a PDSCH/PUSCH (cost 2) shall be taken into account.]
[TDD - In the case of Physical Shared Channel Reconfiguration, the sum of the consumption cost of the each PDSCH/PUSCH of the previous configuration shall be credited to the capacity credit, and the sum of the consumption cost of each PDSCH/PUSCH of the new configuration shall be subtracted from the capacity credit.]

9.2.2.13Ja	E-DCH Capacity Consumption Law
The capacity consumption law indicates to the CRNC how the Capacity Credit is consumed by NBAP set of procedures, depending on the RL/RLS situation and the number of uplink E-DPDCHs and their spreading factors. The reference spreading factor and number of E-DPDCH is signalled using the Maximum Set of E-DPDCHs IE.
This capacity consumption law indicates the consumption law to be used with the following procedures :
-	Radio Link Setup
-	Radio Link Addition
-	Radio Link Reconfiguration
-	Radio Link Deletion
For the Radio Link Setup and Radio Link Addition procedures, the cost given in the consumption law shall be debited from the Capacity Credit, whereas it shall credited to the Capacity Credit for the Radio Link Deletion procedure. For the Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure, the difference of the consumption cost for the new spreading factor and the consumption cost for the old spreading factor shall be debited from the Capacity Credit (or credited when this difference is negative).
If the modelling of the internal resource capability of the Node B is modelled independently for the Uplink and Downlink, the DL cost shall be applied to the DL or Global Capacity Credit and the UL Cost shall be applied to the UL Capacity Credit. If it is modelled as shared resources, both the DL costs and the UL costs shall be applied to the DL or Global Capacity Credit.
For a Radio Link creating a Radio Link Set (first RL of a RLS), the cost for the RL (cost 2) and RLS (cost 1) shall be taken into account. When adding a Radio Link to a Radio Link Set, only the RL cost (cost 2) shall be taken into account.
In the case where multiple Radio Links are established in one procedure, for every created Radio Link Set, the first Radio Link is always the Radio Link with the lowest repetition number.
The costs given in the consumption law are the costs per channelization code/no of E-DPDCH.

This parameter indicates the Multicell E-DCH Transport Bearer Mode. For Multicell E-DCH Transport Bearer Mode  = "Separate Iub Transport Bearer Mode" the Mac-d flows from each carrier uses different Iub transport bearers, for Multicell E-DCH Transport Bearer Mode  = "UL Flow Multiplexing Mode" the Mac-d flows received on the different carriers in the Node B is multiplexed on one Iub transport bearer (per Mac-d flow). The CRNC should apply the stored cell capabilities for the cell on primary UL frequency for the capabilities related to Multicell E-DCH Transport Bearer Mode.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.0	General
NBAP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.680 [12] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [13].
Subclause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of NBAP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this subclause and the tabular format in subclauses 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of NBAP messages. NBAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct a NBAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules (Note that in the following IE means an IE in the object set with an explicit id. If one IE needed to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
If a NBAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
9.3.1	Usage of Private Message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used.
-	For special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multi-vendor inter-operability.
-	By vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.

9.4	Message Transfer Syntax
NBAP shall use the ASN.1 Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER) Aligned Variant as transfer syntax as specified in ref. ITU T Rec. X.691 [11].
9.5	Timers
TPreempt
-	Specifies the maximum time that a Node B may wait for pre-emption of resources for establishment or reconfiguration of Radio Links.
10	Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
10.1	General
Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:
-	Transfer Syntax Error
-	Abstract Syntax Error
-	Logical Error
Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving node:

Figure 38: Protocol Errors in NBAP.
The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included in the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be included. Other optional information elements within the message may also be included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the reporting is done with a response message. The latter is an exception to what is stated in subclause 4.1.
10.2	Transfer Syntax Error
A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode the received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always detected in the process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error occurs, the receiver should initiate Error Indication procedure with appropriate cause value for the Transfer Syntax protocol error.
Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:
-	Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. e.g.: If an IE has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and 12 will be received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax error.
-	Violation in list element constraints. e.g.: If a list is defined as containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, than this case will be handled as a transfer syntax error.
-	Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the originator of the message).
-	Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the originator of the message).
10.3	Abstract Syntax Error
10.3.1	General
An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional NBAP entity:
1.	receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown id);
2.	receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g.: ASN.1 definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10 (values 11 to 15 are undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an abstract syntax error using criticality information sent by the originator of the message);
3.	does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence of the concerned object, the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the received message;
4.	receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group;
5.	receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the concerned object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE groups should not have been present in the received message.
Cases 1 and 2 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on received Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is handled based on Criticality information and Presence information for the missing IE/IE group specified in the version of the specification used by the receiver. Case 4 (IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences) and Case 5 (erroneously present conditional IEs or IE groups) result in rejecting the procedure.
If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the remaining message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error that belong to cases 1-3 act according to the Criticality Information and Presence Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract Syntax Error occurred in accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is specified in subclause 10.3.6.
10.3.2	Criticality Information
In the NBAP messages there is criticality information set for individual IEs and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver how to act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended, i.e. the entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully or partially) comprehended shall be treated in accordance with its own criticality information as specified in subclause 10.3.4.
In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing IE/IE group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).
The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the Criticality Information. The three possible values of the Criticality Information for an IE/IE group are:
-	Reject IE
-	Ignore IE and Notify Sender
	Ignore IE
The following rules restrict when a receiving entity may consider an IE, an IE group or an EP not comprehended (not implemented), and when action based on criticality information is applicable:
1.	IE or IE group: When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for one EP from a standard version, then other new or modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered comprehended by the receiving entity (some may still remain unsupported).
2.	EP: The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not supported may be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from that standard version is comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.
10.3.3	Presence Information
For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1 transfer syntax, NBAP specifies separately if the presence of these IEs/IE groups is optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application by means of the presence field of the concerned object of class NBAP-PROTOCOL-IES, NBAP-PROTOCOL-IES-PAIR, NBAP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or NBAP-PRIVATE-IES.
The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:
-	Optional;
-	Conditional;
-	Mandatory.
If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence of the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the condition is true according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE group.
If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of the IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE group.
10.3.4	Not comprehended IE/IE group
10.3.4.1	Procedure ID
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality information of the Procedure ID according to the following:
Reject IE:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure ID marked with "Reject IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall reject the procedure using the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure ID marked with "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE:
-	If a message is received with a Procedure ID marked with "Ignore IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the procedure.
When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to report an ignored procedure it shall include the Procedure ID IE, the Triggering Message IE, and the Procedure Criticality IE in the Criticality Diagnostics IE.
10.3.4.1A	Type of Message
When the receiving node cannot decode the Type of Message IE, the Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
10.3.4.2	IEs Other Than the Procedure ID and Type of Message
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality information of an IE/IE group other than the Procedure ID IE and Type of Message IE according to the following:
Reject IE:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Reject IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the rejection of one or more IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Reject IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Reject IE" that the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups and report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
Ignore IE:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Ignore IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
-	If a response message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with "Ignore IE" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with "Reject IE" or "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" using a response message defined for the procedure, the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. In the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE the Repetition Number IE shall be included and in addition, if the not comprehended IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the Message Structure IE shall be included.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with "Reject IE" or "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" using the Error Indication procedure, the Procedure ID IE, the Triggering Message IE, Procedure Criticality IE, the Transaction ID IE, and the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. In the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE the Repetition Number IE shall be included and in addition, if the not comprehended IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the Message Structure IE shall be included.
10.3.5	Missing IE or IE Group
The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received message specified in the version of this specification used by the receiver:
Reject IE:
1.	If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Reject IE"; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a received message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Reject IE", the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Reject IE", the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
Ignore IE and Notify Sender:
-	If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Ignore IE and Notify Sender", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
-	If a received message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Ignore IE and Notify Sender", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
-	If a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Ignore IE and Notify Sender", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
Ignore IE:
1.	If a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Ignore IE", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
2.	If a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Ignore IE", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Reject IE" or "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" using a response message defined for the procedure, the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. In the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE the Repetition Number IE shall be included and in addition, if the missing IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the Message Structure IE shall be included.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "Reject IE" or "Ignore IE and Notify Sender" using the Error Indication procedure, the Procedure ID IE, the Triggering Message IE, Procedure Criticality IE, the Transaction ID IE, and the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE shall be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE/IE group. In the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE the Repetition Number IE shall be included and in addition, if the missing IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the Message Structure IE shall be included.
10.3.6	IEs or IE Groups Received in Wrong Order or With Too Many Occurrences or Erroneously Present
If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional presence are present when the condition is not met (i.e. erroneously present), the receiving node shall behave according to the following:
-	If a message initiating a procedure is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value "Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)" using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
4.	If a message initiating a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure, and use cause value "Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)".
-	If a response message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the specification version used by the receiver shall be considered.
10.4	Logical Error
Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly, but the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e. semantic error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with the state of the receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour shall be performed (unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class of the elementary procedure, irrespective of the criticality of the IEs/IE groups containing the erroneous values.
Class 1:
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1 procedure, and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. 
Typical cause values are:
-	Protocol Causes:
1.	Semantic Error
2.	Message not compatible with receiver state
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1 procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the ERROR INDICATION procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure ID IE, the Triggering Message IE and the Transaction ID IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
Class 2:
Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the procedure shall be terminated and the ERROR INDICATION procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The Procedure ID IE, the Triggering Message IE and the Transaction ID IE within the Criticality Diagnostics IE shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
10.5	Exceptions
The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take precedence over any other error handling described in the other subclause of clause 10.
-	If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local error handling.
-	In case a response message or ERROR INDICATION message needs to be returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
-	If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause value shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality “ignore and notify” have earlier occurred within the same procedure.
Annex A (normative):
Allocation and Pre-emption of Radio Links in the Node B
A.1	Deriving Allocation Information for a Radio Link
A.1.1	Establishment of a New Radio Link
The Allocation Information for a Radio Link in the case of establishment of a new Radio Link shall be derived as follows:
-	The latest received Allocation/Retention Priority IE for each transport channel shall be used.
NOTE:	The Allocation/Retention Priority IE for a transport channel may have been received in 
a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for the Node B Communication Context in the Node B or
b) a procedure adding or modifying the transport channel.
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for all transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link is set to "no priority", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link shall be set to "shall not trigger pre-emption".
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for one or more of the transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link is not set to "no priority", the allocation priority and the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link shall be set according to the following:
-	The transport channels that have the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE set to "no priority" shall be excluded when setting the allocation priority and pre-emption capability of a Radio Link.
-	The allocation priority for a Radio Link shall be set to highest priority level, given by the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, for all non excluded transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link.
-	If all non-excluded transport channels that are intended to use a Radio Link to be established have the pre-emption capability, given by the Pre-emption Capability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, set to "shall not trigger pre-emption", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link shall be set to "shall not trigger pre-emption".
If one or more non-excluded transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link to be established have the value of the Pre-emption Capability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE set to "may trigger pre-emption", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link shall be set to "may trigger pre-emption".
The derived allocation priority and pre-emption capability are only valid during this allocation/retention process.
A.1.2	Modification of an Existing Radio Link 
The Allocation Information for a Radio Link in the case of modification of a Radio Link (addition or modification of transport channels using the Radio Link) shall be derived as follows:
-	The latest received Allocation/Retention Priority IE for each transport channel shall be used.
NOTE:	The Allocation/Retention Priority IE for a transport channel may have been received in 
a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for the Node B Communication Context in the Node B,
b) a previous procedure adding or modifying the transport channel, or
c) the current procedure adding or modifying the transport channel.
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for all transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio Link is set to "no priority", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall be set to "shall not trigger pre-emption".
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for one or more of the transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio Link is not set to "no priority", the allocation priority of and the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall be set according to the following:
-	The transport channels to be added or modified that have the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE set to "no priority" shall be excluded when setting the allocation priority and pre-emption capability of a Radio Link to be modified.
-	The allocation priority for a Radio Link to be modified shall be set to highest priority level, given by the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, for all the non-excluded transport channels that are to be added or modified.
-	If all non-excluded transport channels that are to be added or modified in the Radio Link have the pre-emption capability, given by the Pre-emption Capability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, set to "shall not trigger pre-emption", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall be set to "shall not trigger pre-emption".
If one or more of the non-excluded transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio Link have the value of the Pre-emption Capability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE set to "may trigger pre-emption", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall be set to "may trigger pre-emption".
The derived allocation priority and pre-emption capability are only valid during this allocation/retention process.
A.2	Deriving Retention Information for a Radio Link
The Retention Information for an existing Radio Link shall be derived as follows:
-	The latest received Allocation/Retention Priority IE for each transport channel shall be used.
NOTE:	The Allocation/Retention Priority IE for a transport channel may have been received in 
a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for the Node B Communication Context in the Node B or
b) a procedure adding or modifying the transport channel.
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for one or more transport channels using the Radio Link is set to "no priority", the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set to "not pre-emptable".
-	If the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE for all the transport channels using the Radio Link is not set to "no priority", the retention priority of the Radio Link and the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set according to the following:
-	The retention priority for a Radio Link shall be set to highest priority level, given by the Priority Level IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, for all transport channels that uses the Radio Link.
-	If all transport channels that uses the Radio Link have the pre-emption vulnerability, given by the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, set to "pre-emptable", the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set to "pre-emptable".
If one or more transport channels that uses the Radio Link have the value of the Pre-emption Vulnerability IE in the Allocation/Retention Priority IE set to "not pre-emptable", the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set to "not pre-emptable".
The derived retention priority and pre-emption vulnerability are valid until they are changed, or until the Radio Link is deleted. When new transport channels are added to or deleted from the Radio Link or when existing transport channels are modified with regards to the Allocation/Retention Priority IE, the retention information shall be derived again according to above.
A.3	The Allocation/Retention Process
The Node B shall establish or modify the resources for a Radio Link according to:
-	The value of the Allocation Information (allocation priority and pre-emption capability) of the Radio Link to be established or modified. The Allocation Information is derived according to clause A.1.
-	The value of the Retention Information (retention priority and pre-emption vulnerability) of existing Radio Links. The Retention Information derived according to clause A.2.
-	The resource situation in the cell.
Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption functionality is operator dependent, the pre-emption indicators (pre-emption capability and pre-emption vulnerability) shall be treated as follows:
-	If the pre-emption capability for a Radio Link to be established or modified is set to "may trigger pre-emption" and the resource situation so requires, the Node B may trigger the pre-emption process in clause A.4 to free resources for this allocation request.
-	If the pre-emption capability for a Radio Link to be established or modified is set to "shall not trigger pre-emption", then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption process in clause A.4.
-	If the pre-emption vulnerability for an existing Radio Link is set to "pre-emptable", then this Radio Link shall be included in the pre-emption process in clause A.4.
-	If the pre-emption vulnerability for an existing Radio Link is set to "not pre-emptable", then this Radio Link shall not be included in the pre-emption process in clause A.4.
A.4	The Pre-emption Process
The pre-emption process shall only pre-empt Radio Links with lower retention priority than the allocation priority of the Radio Link to be established or modified. The Radio Links to be pre-empted shall be selected in ascending order of the retention priority.
When the pre-emption process detects that one or more Radio Links have to be pre-empted to free resources for a Radio Link(s) to be established or modified, the Node B shall initiate the Radio Link Pre-emption procedure for all the Node B Communication Contexts having Radio Links selected for pre-emption and start the TPreempt timer.
When enough resources are freed to establish or modify the Radio Link(s) according to the request, the Node B shall stop the TPreempt timer and complete the procedure that triggered the pre-emption process in accordance with the "Successful Operation" subclause of the procedure.
If the TPreempt timer expires, the Node B shall regard the procedure that triggered the pre-emption process as failed and complete the procedure in accordance with the "Unsuccessful Operation" subclause of the procedure.
Annex B (informative):
Measurement Reporting
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event A" (figure B.1), the Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated when the measured entity rises above the requested threshold and stays there for the requested hysteresis time. If no hysteresis time is given, the value zero shall be used for the hysteresis time.


Figure B.1: Event A reporting with Hysteresis Time specified
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event B" (figure B.2), the Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated when the measured entity falls below the requested threshold and stays there for the requested hysteresis time. If no hysteresis time is given, the value zero shall be used for the hysteresis time.

Figure B.2: Event B reporting with Hysteresis Time specified
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event C" (figure B.3), the Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated always when the measured entity rises by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the requested time. The reporting in figure B.3 is initiated if the Rising Time T1 is less than the requested time.


Figure B.3: Event C reporting
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event D" (figure B.4), the Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated always when the measured entity falls by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the requested time. The reporting in figure B.4 is initiated if the Falling Time T1 is less than the requested time.


Figure B.4: Event D reporting

When the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event E" (figure B.5), the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated always when the measured entity rises above the ‘Measurement Threshold 1’ and stays there for the ‘Measurement Hysteresis Time’ (T1 in figure B.5). If Report Periodicity IE is provided Node B shall also initiate Measurement Reporting procedure periodically. The periodic reporting continues although the measured entity falls below the ‘Measurement Threshold 1’ and is terminated by the Report B.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measured entity falls below the ‘Measurement Threshold 2’ and stays there for the ‘Measurement Hysteresis Time’ (T1) Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) is initiated and the periodic reporting is terminated.

Figure B.5: Event E reporting with Hysteresis Time specified and Periodic Reporting requested
When the Report Characteristics IE is set to "Event F" (figure B.6), the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated always when the measured entity falls below the ‘Measurement Threshold 1’ and stays there for the ‘Measurement Hysteresis Time’ (T1 in figure B.6). If Report Periodicity IE is provided Node B shall also initiate Measurement Reporting procedure periodically. The periodic reporting continues although the measured entity rises above the ‘Measurement Threshold 1’ and is terminated by the Report B.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measured entity rises above the ‘Measurement Threshold 2’ and stays there for the ‘Measurement Hysteresis Time’ (T1) Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) is initiated and the periodic reporting is terminated.

Annex D (normative):
IB_SG_DATA Encoding
D.1	Overall Description
There exist two variants for encoding IB_SG_DATA IE (see section 9.2.1.32), which are detailed in subsections below. To avoid incorrect transmission of System Information on Uu, the following behaviour is required:
-	For each Iub, CRNC shall use the encoding variant supported by the Node B for the IB_SG_DATA IE (see section 9.2.1.32) when sending the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message to the Node B. This is supported by configuration in the CRNC.
D.2	IB_SG_DATA Encoding Variant 1
This variant corresponds to the algorithm, that ASN.1 length encoding for the conveyed SIB segment is performed by the RNC. Building of IB_SG_DATA segments involves two steps:
1)	Segmentation of MIB/SIB/SB and
2)	RRC encoding of the segments, which includes the PER encoding of the length in case of "SIB data variable".


Figure D.1: The Building of Segments

D.3	IB_SG_DATA Encoding Variant 2
This variant corresponds to the algorithm, that ASN.1 length encoding for the conveyed segment is not performed by the RNC. Segments are built in the CRNC by segmentation of a MIB/SIB/SB.


Figure D.2: The Building of Segments

Annex E (informative):
Reporting the status of resources used for frequency (1.28 Mcps TDD only) 
For a multi-frequency cell, the Local Cell represents the resources in the Node B that can be used for the configuration of a number of frequencies in the cell. The resources for a frequency in Node B are defined as FPM (Frequency Process Module) and is identified by FPM ID.
In the Cell Setup procedure, RNC should configure FPM for each frequency by including FPM ID IE in the CELL SETUP REQUEST message.
In the Cell Reconfiguration procedure, RNC should configure FPM for each added frequency by including FPM ID IE in the CELL RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message.
In Audit procedure, the Node B should include the FPM ID IE and the Local Cell ID IE in the Local Cell Information IE to report the status of a FPM in the AUDIT RESPONSE message.
In Resource Status Indication procedure, the Node B should include the FPM ID IE and the Local Cell ID IE in the Local Cell Information IE to report the status of a FPM in the RESOURCE STATUS INDICATION message.
