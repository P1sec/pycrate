Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x	the first digit:
1	presented to TSG for information;
2	presented to TSG for approval;
3	or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y	the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z	the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
shall	indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
shall not	indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions "shall" and "shall not" are confined to the context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions "must" and "must not" are not used as substitutes for "shall" and "shall not". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced document.
should	indicates a recommendation to do something
should not	indicates a recommendation not to do something
may	indicates permission to do something
need not	indicates permission not to do something
The construction "may not" is ambiguous and is not used in normative elements. The unambiguous constructions "might not" or "shall not" are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
can	indicates that something is possible
cannot	indicates that something is impossible
The constructions "can" and "cannot" are not substitutes for "may" and "need not".
will	indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document
will not	indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document
might	indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document
might not	indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document
In addition:
is	(or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact
is not	(or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact
The constructions "is" and "is not" do not indicate requirements.
1	Scope
It is necessary to transfer between entities of a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) information specific to the PLMN in order to deal with the specific behaviour of roaming Mobile Stations (MS)s. The Signalling System No. 7 specified by CCITT is used to transfer this information.
The present document describes the requirements for the signalling system and the procedures needed at the application level in order to fulfil these signalling needs.
Clauses 1 to 6 are related to general aspects such as terminology, mobile network configuration and other protocols required by MAP.
MAP consists of a set of MAP services that are provided to MAP service-users by a MAP service-provider.

Figure 1.1/1: Modelling principles
Clauses 7 to 13A of the present document describe the MAP services.
Clauses 14 to 17 define the MAP protocol specification and the behaviour of service provider (protocol elements to be used to provide MAP services, mapping on to TC service primitives, abstract syntaxes, etc.).
Clauses 18 to 25 describe the MAP user procedures that make use of MAP services.
The present document specifies functions, procedures and information which apply to GERAN Iu mode. However, functionality related to GERAN Iu mode is neither maintained nor enhanced.
2	References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this text, constitute provisions of the present document.
-	References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
-	For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
-	For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies.  In the case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document in the same Release as the present document.

5	Overload and compatibility overview
5.1	Overload control
There is a requirement for an overload/congestion control for all entities of the Public Land Mobile Network and the underlying Signalling System No. 7.
5.1.1	Overload control for MSC (outside MAP)
For the entity MSC the following two procedures (outside MAP) may be applied to control the processor load:
-	ISDN
CCITT Recommendation Q.764 (Automatic Congestion Control), applicable to reduce the mobile terminating traffic;
-	BSSAP
3GPP TS 48.008 [49] (A-interface Flow Control), applicable to reduce the mobile originating traffic.
5.1.2	Overload control for MAP entities
For all MAP entities, especially the HLR, the following overload control method is applied.
If overload of a MAP entity is detected requests for certain MAP operations (see tables 5.1/1, 5.1/2, 5.1/3 and 5.1/4) may be ignored by the responder. The decision as to which MAP Operations may be ignored is made by the MAP service provider and is based upon the priority of the application context.
Since most of the affected MAP operations are supervised in the originating entity by TC timers (medium) an additional delay effect is achieved for the incoming traffic.
If overload levels are applicable in the Location Registers the MAP operations should be discarded taking into account the priority of their application context (see table 5.1/1 for HLR, table 5.1/2 for MSC/VLR, table 5.1/3 for the SGSN and table 5.1/4 for the SMLC; the lowest priority is discarded first).
The ranking of priorities given in the tables 5.1/1, 5.1/2, 5.1/3 and 5.1/4 is not normative. The tables can only be seen as a proposal that might be changed due to network operator/implementation matters.

5.1.3	Congestion control for Signalling System No. 7
The requirements of SS7 Congestion control have to be taken into account as far as possible.
Means that could be applied to achieve the required traffic reductions are described in clauses 5.1.1 and 5.1.2.
5.2	Compatibility
5.2.1	General
The present document of the Mobile Application Part is designed in such a way that an implementation which conforms to it can also conform to the Mobile Application Part operational version 1 specifications, except on the MSC-VLR interface.
A version negotiation mechanism based on the use of an application-context-name is used to negotiate the protocol version used between two entities for supporting a MAP-user signalling procedure.
When starting a signalling procedure, the MAP-user supplies an application-context-name to the MAP-provider. This name refers to the set of application layer communication capabilities required for this dialogue. This refers to the required TC facilities (e.g. version 1 or 2) and the list of operation packages (i.e. set of operations) from which operations can be invoked during the dialogue.
A version one application-context-name may only be transferred to the peer user in a MAP-U-ABORT to an entity of version two or higher (i.e. to trigger a dialogue which involves only communication capabilities defined for MAP operational version 1).
If the proposed application-context-name can be supported by the responding entity the dialogue continues on this basis otherwise the dialogue is refused and the initiating user needs to start a new dialogue, which involves another application-context-name which requires less communication capabilities but provides similar functionality (if possible).
When a signalling procedure can be supported by several application contexts that differ by their version number, the MAP-User needs to select a name. It can either select the name that corresponds to the highest version it supports or follow a more specific strategy so that the number of protocol fallbacks due to version compatibility problems is minimised.
5.2.2	Strategy for selecting the Application Context (AC) version
A method should be used to minimise the number of protocol fall-backs which would occur sometimes if the highest supported AC-Name were always the one selected by GSM entities when initiating a dialogue. The following method is an example that can be used mainly at transitory phase stage when the network is one of mixed phase entities.
5.2.2.1	Proposed method
A table (table 1) may be set up by administrative action to define the highest application context (AC) version supported by each destination; a destination may be another node within the same or a different PLMN, or another PLMN considered as a single entity. The destination may be defined by an E.164 number or an E.214 number derived from an IMSI or in North America (World Zone 1) by an E.164 number or an IMSI (E.212 number). The table also includes the date when each destination is expected to be able to handle at least one AC of the latest version of the MAP protocol. When this date is reached, the application context supported by the node is marked as "unknown", which will trigger the use of table 2.
A second table (table 2) contains an entry for each destination that has an entry in table 1. For a given entity, the entry in table 2 may be a single application context version or a vector of different versions applying to different application contexts for that entity. Table 2 is managed as described in clause 5.2.2.2.
The data for each destination will go through the following states:
a)	the version shown in table 1 is "version n-1", where 'n' is the highest version existing in this specification; table 2 is not used;
b)	the version shown in table 1 is "unknown"; table 2 is used, and maintained as described in clause 5.2.2.2;
c)	when the PLMN operator declares that an entity (single node or entire PLMN) has been upgraded to support all the MAP version n ACs defined for the relevant interface, the version shown in table 1 is set to "version n" by administrative action; table 2 is no longer used, and the storage space may be recovered.
5.2.2.2	Managing the version look-up table
WHEN it receives a MAP-OPEN ind the MAP-User determines the originating entity number either using the originating address parameter or the originating reference parameter or retrieving it from the subscriber data using the IMSI or the MSISDN.
IF the entity number is known:
THEN
	It updates (if required) the associated list of highest supported ACs.
ELSE
	It creates an entry for this entity and includes the received AC-name in the list of highest supported ACs.
WHEN starting a procedure, the originating MAP-user looks up its version control table.
IF the destination address is known and not timed-out.
THEN
It retrieves the appropriate AC-name and uses it
IF the dialogue is accepted by the peer
THEN
It does not modify the version control table
ELSE (this should never occur)
	It starts a new dialogue with the common highest version supported (based on information implicitly or explicitly provided by the peer).
	It replaces the old AC-name by the new one in the list of associated highest AC supported.
ELSE
	It uses the AC-name that corresponds to the highest version it supports.
IF the dialogue is accepted by the peer.
THEN
	It adds the destination node in its version control table and includes the AC-Name in the list of associated highest AC supported.
ELSE
	It starts a new dialogue with the common highest version supported (based on information implicitly or explicitly provided by the peer).
IF the destination node was not known
THEN
	It adds the destination node in its version control table and includes the new AC-Name in the list of associated highest AC supported.
ELSE
	It replaces the old AC-name by the new one in the list of highest supported AC and reset the timer.
5.2.2.3	Optimising the method
A table look-up may be avoided in some cases if both the HLR and the VLR or both the HLR and the SGSN store for each subscriber the version of the AC-name used at location updating. Then:
-	for procedures which make use of the same application-context, the same AC-name (thus the same version) can be selected (without any table look-up) when the procedure is triggered;
-	for procedures which make use of a different application-context but which includes one of the packages used by the location updating AC, the same version can be selected (without any table look-up) when the procedure is triggered;
for HLR:
-	Subscriber data modification (stand alone);
for VLR:
-	Data Restoration.
6	Requirements concerning the use of SCCP and TC
6.1	Use of SCCP
The Mobile Application Part (MAP) makes use of the services offered by the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP).
MAP supports the following SCCP versions:
-	Signalling Connection Control Part, Signalling System no. 7 CCITT ('Blue Book SCCP');
-	Signalling Connection Control Part, Signalling System no. 7 ITU-T Recommendation (07/96) Q.711 to Q.716 ('White Book SCCP'). Support of White Book SCCP at the receiving side shall be mandated from 00:01hrs, 1st July 2002(UTC). However, for signalling over the MAP E-interface to support inter-MSC handover/relocation, the support of White Book SCCP shall be mandated with immediate effect.
A White Book SCCP message will fail if any signalling point used in the transfer of the message does not support White Book SCCP. Therefore it is recommended that the originator of the White Book SCCP message supports a drop back mechanism or route capability determination mechanism to interwork with signalling points that are beyond the control of GSM/UMTS network operators.
In North America (World Zone 1) the national version of SCCP is used as specified in ANSI T1.112. Interworking between a PLMN in North America and a PLMN outside North America will involve an STP to translate between ANSI SCCP and ITU-T/CCITT SCCP.
The SCCP is identified as an MTP3-user and the transport of SCCP messages between two entities shall be accomplished according to the 3GPP TS 29.202 [121].
6.1.1	SCCP Class
MAP will only make use of the connectionless classes (0 or 1) of the SCCP.
6.1.2	Sub-System Number (SSN)
The Application Entities (AEs) defined for MAP consist of several Application Service Elements (ASEs) and are addressed by sub-system numbers (SSNs). The SSNs for MAP are specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [17].
When the SGSN emulates MSC behaviour for processing messages (MAP-MO-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE, MAP_CHECK_IMEI, MAP_SUBSCRIBER_LOCATION_REPORT) towards entities which do not support interworking to SGSNs, it shall use the MSC SSN in the calling party address instead of the SGSN SSN. 
When present in the network, the Presence Network Agent emulates the behaviour of the GSM Service Control Function (gsm SCF) for processing of messages (MAP-NOTE-MM-EVENT, MAP-ANY-TIME-INTERROGATION and MAP-ANY-TIME-MODIFICATION).
When a FFN (Follow Me Functional Node, see TS 23.094 [129]) is implemented in a network entity different from HLR, this network entity shall emulate HLR behaviour, i.e. it shall accept MAP-PROCESS-UNSTRUCTURED-SS-REQUEST messages addressed with SSN for HLR.
In an EPS, an Interworking Function (IWF) may be used to convert Diameter S6a messages to MAP Gr messages and vice versa; also an IWF may be used to convert Diameter S13 messages to MAP Gf messages and vice versa. An SSN value for the IWF does not exist. Instead the IWF shall use the SGSN SSN value when serving an MME and use the HLR SSN when serving an HSS. An IWF is said to serve an MME (or HSS) when Diameter messages are exchanged between the IWF and the MME (or HSS).

6.1.3	SCCP addressing
6.1.3.1	Introduction
Within the GSM System there will be a need to communicate between entities within the same PLMN and in different PLMNs. Using the Mobile Application Part (MAP) for this function implies the use of Transaction Capabilities (TC) and the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) of CCITT Signalling System No. 7.
Only the entities that should be addressed are described below. If the CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used, the format and coding of address parameters carried by the SCCP for that purpose shall comply with CCITT Recommendation Q.713 with the following restrictions:
1)	Intra-PLMN addressing
	For communication between entities within the same PLMN, a MAP SSN shall always be included in the called and calling party addresses. All other aspects of SCCP addressing are network specific.
2)	Inter-PLMN addressing
a)	Called Party Address
-	SSN indicator = 1 (MAP SSN always included);
-	Global title indicator = 0100 (Global title includes translation type, numbering plan, encoding scheme and nature of address indicator);
-	the translation type field will be coded "00000000" (Not used). For call related messages for non-optimal routed calls (as described in 3GPP TS 23.066 [108]) directed to another PLMN the translation type field may be coded "10000000" (CRMNP);
-	Routing indicator = 0 (Routing on global title);
b)	Calling Party Address
-	SSN indicator = 1 (MAP SSNs always included);
-	Point code indicator = 0;
-	Global title indicator = 0100 (Global title includes translation type, numbering plan, encoding scheme and nature of address indicator);
-	Numbering Plan = 0001 (ISDN Numbering Plan, E.164; In Case of Inter-PLMN Signalling, the dialogue initiating entity and dialogue responding entity shall always include its own E.164 Global Title as Calling Party Address);
-	the translation type field will be coded "00000000" (Not used);
-	Routing indicator = 0 (Routing on Global Title).
If ANSI T1.112 SCCP is used, the format and coding of address parameters carried by the SCCP for that purpose shall comply with ANSI specification T1.112 with the following restrictions:
1)	Intra-PLMN addressing
	For communication between entities within the same PLMN, a MAP SSN shall always be included in the called and calling party addresses. All other aspects of SCCP addressing are network specific.
2)	Inter-PLMN addressing
a)	Called Party Address
-	SSN indicator = 1 (MAP SSN always included);
-	Global title indicator = 0010 (Global title includes translation type);
-	the Translation Type (TT) field will be coded as follows:
	TT = 9, if IMSI is included;
	TT = 14, if MSISDN is included;
	Or TT = 10, if Network Element is included. (If TT=10, then Number Portability GTT is not invoked, if TT=14, then Number Portability GTT may be invoked).
-	Routing indicator = 0 (Routing on global title);
b)	Calling Party Address
-	SSN indicator = 1 (MAP SSNs always included);
-	Point code indicator = 0;
-	Global Title indicator = 0010 (Global title includes translation type);
	TT = 9, if IMSI is included;
	TT = 14, if MSISDN is included;
	Or TT = 10, if Network Element is included. (If TT=10, then Number Portability GTT is not invoked, if TT=14, then Number Portability GTT may be invoked).
Routing indicator = 0 (Routing on Global Title).
If a Global Title translation is required for obtaining routeing information, one of the numbering plans E.164, E.212 and E.214 is applicable.
-	E.212 numbering plan.
	When CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used, an E.212 number must not be included as Global Title in an SCCP UNITDATA message. The translation of an E.212 number into a Mobile Global Title is applicable in a dialogue initiating VLR, SGSN or GGSN if the routeing information towards the HLR is derived from the subscriber's IMSI. In World Zone 1 when ANSI SCCP is used, the IMSI (E.212 number) is used as a Global Title to address the HLR. When an MS moves from one VLR service area to another, the new VLR may derive the address of the previous VLR from the Location Area Identification provided by the MS in the location registration request. The PLMN where the previous VLR is located is identified by the E.212 numbering plan elements of the Location Area Identification, i.e. the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC).
-	E.214 and E.164 numbering plans.
	When CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used, only address information belonging to either E.214 or E.164 numbering plan is allowed to be included as Global Title in the Called and Calling Party Address. In World Zone 1 when ANSI SCCP is used, the IMSI (E.212 number) is used as a Global Title to address the HLR.
	If the Calling Party Address associated with the dialogue initiating message contains a Global Title, the sending network entity shall include its E.164 entity number.
	When receiving an SCCP UNITDATA message, SCCP shall accept either of the valid numbering plans in the Called Party Address and in the Calling Party Address.
	When CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used and an N-UNITDATA-REQUEST primitive from TC is received, SCCP shall accept an E.164 number or an E.214 number in the Called Address and in the Calling Address. In World Zone 1 when ANSI SCCP is used, the IMSI (E.212 number) is used instead of E.214 number.
The following clauses describe the method of SCCP addressing appropriate for each entity both for the simple intra‑PLMN case and where an inter-PLMN communication is required. The following entities are considered:
-	the Mobile-services Switching Centre (MSC);
-	the Home location Register (HLR);
-	the Visitor Location Register (VLR);
-	the Gateway Mobile-services Switching Centre (GMSC);
-	the GSM Service Control Function (gsmSCF);
-	the Interworking Mobile-services Switching Centre (IWMSC);
-	the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN);
-	the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN);
-	the Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC);
-	the CSG Subscriber Server (CSS).
6.1.3.2	The Mobile-services Switching Centre (MSC)
There are several cases where it is necessary to address the MSC.
6.1.3.2.1	MSC interaction during handover or relocation
The address is derived from the target Cell id or from the target RNC id.
6.1.3.2.2	MSC for short message routing
When a short message has to be routed to an MS, the GMSC addresses the VMSC by an MSC identity received from the HLR that complies with E.164 rules.
For MS originating short message, the IWMSC address is derived from the Service Centre address.
6.1.3.2.3	MSC for location request routing
When a location request for a particular MS needs to be sent to the MS's VMSC, the GMLC addresses the VMSC using an E.164 address received from the MS's HLR.
6.1.3.2.4	MSC for LMU Control
When a control message has to be routed to an LMU from an SMLC, the SMLC addresses the serving MSC for the LMU using an E.164 address.
6.1.3.3	The Home Location Register (HLR)
There are several cases where the HLR has to be addressed.
6.1.3.3.1	During call set-up
When a call is initiated the HLR of the called mobile subscriber will be interrogated to discover the whereabouts of the MS. The addressing required by the SCCP will be derived from the MSISDN dialled by the calling subscriber. The dialled number will be translated into either an SPC, in the case of communications within a PLMN, or a Global Title if other networks are involved (i.e. if the communication is across a PLMN boundary).
If the calling subscriber is a fixed network subscriber, the interrogation can be initiated from the Gateway MSC of the home PLMN in the general case. If the topology of the network allows it, the interrogation could be initiated from any Signalling Point that has MAP capabilities, e.g. local exchange, outgoing International Switching Centre (ISC), etc.
6.1.3.3.2	Before location updating completion
When an MS registers for the first time in a VLR, the VLR has to initiate the update location dialogue with the MS's HLR and a preceding dialogue for authentication information retrieval if the authentication information must be retrieved from the HLR. When initiating either of these dialogues, the only data for addressing the HLR that the VLR has available is contained in the IMSI, and addressing information for SCCP must be derived from it. When continuing the established update location dialogue (as with any other dialogue), the VLR must derive the routeing information towards the HLR from the Calling Party Address received with the first responding CONTINUE message until the dialogue terminating message is received. This means that the VLR must be able to address the HLR based on:
-	an E.214 Mobile Global Title originally derived by the VLR from the IMSI (when CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used), or an E.212 number originally derived from IMSI (when ANSI SCCP is used, an IMSI); or
-	an E.164 HLR address; or
-	in the case of intra-PLMN signalling, an SPC.
When answering with Global Title to the VLR, the HLR shall insert its E.164 address in the Calling Party Address of the SCCP message containing the first responding CONTINUE message.
If the HLR is in the same PLMN as the VLR, local translation tables may exist to derive an SPC. For authentication information retrieval and location updating via the international PSTN/ISDN signalling network that requires the use of CCITT or ITU-T SCCP, the Global Title must be derived from the IMSI, using the principles contained in CCITT Recommendation E.214 and the Numbering Plan Indicator (NPI) value referenced by the SCCP Specifications. In World Zone 1 where the ANSI SCCP is used, IMSI (E.212 number) is used as Global Title. A summary of the translation from the IMSI (CCITT Recommendation E.212) to Mobile Global Title (described in CCITT Recommendation E.214) is shown below:
-	E.212 Mobile Country Code translates to E.164 Country Code;
-	E.212 Mobile Network Code translates to E.164 National Destination Code;
-	E.212 Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) is carried unchanged if within the E.164 number maximum length (15 digits). If the Mobile Global Title is more than 15 digits the number is truncated to 15 by deleting the least significant digits.
This translation will be done either at the application or at SCCP level in the VLR. The Mobile Global Title thus derived will be used to address the HLR.
If location updating is triggered by an MS that roams from one MSC Area into a different MSC Area served by the same VLR, the VLR shall address the HLR in the same way as if the MS registers for the first time in the VLR.
6.1.3.3.3	After location updating completion
In this case, the subscriber's basic MSISDN has been received from the HLR during the subscriber data retrieval procedure as well as the HLR number constituting a parameter of the MAP message indicating successful completion of the update location dialogue. From either of these E.164 numbers the address information for initiating dialogues with the roaming subscriber's HLR can be derived. Also the subscriber's IMSI may be used for establishing the routeing information towards the HLR. This may apply in particular if the dialogue with the HLR is triggered by subscriber controlled input.
Thus the SCCP address of the roaming subscriber's HLR may be an SPC, or it may be a Global title consisting of the E.164 MSISDN or the E.164 number allocated to the HLR or either the E.214 Mobile Global Title derived from the IMSI if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used, or the IMSI if ANSI SCCP is used (ANSI SCCP is used in World Zone 1).
6.1.3.3.4	VLR restoration
If a roaming number is requested by the HLR for an IMSI that has no data record in the interrogated VLR, the VLR provides the roaming number in the dialogue terminating message. Subsequently the VLR must retrieve the authentication data from the MS's HLR, if required, and must then trigger the restore data procedure. For this purpose, the VLR has to initiate in succession two independent dialogues with the MS's HLR. The MTP and SCCP address information needed for routeing towards the HLR can be derived from the IMSI received as a parameter of the MAP message requesting the roaming number. In this case, the IMSI received from the HLR in the roaming number request shall be processed in the same way as the IMSI that is received from an MS that registers for the first time within a VLR. Alternatively to the IMSI, the Calling Party Address associated with the roaming number request may be used to obtain the routeing information towards the HLR.
6.1.3.3.5	During Network-Requested PDP Context Activation
When receiving a PDP PDU the GGSN may interrogate the HLR of the MS for information retrieval. When initiating such a dialogue, the only data for addressing the HLR that the GGSN has available is contained in the IMSI, and addressing information must be derived from it. The IMSI is obtained from the IP address or the X.25 address in the incoming IP message by means of a translation table. This means that the GGSN shall be able to address the HLR based on an E.214, (if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used), or E.212 (if ANSI SCCP is used), Mobile Global Title originally derived by the GGSN from the IMSI in the case of inter-PLMN signalling. In the case of intra-PLMN signalling, an SPC may also be used.
If the HLR is in the same PLMN as the GGSN, local translation tables may exist to derive an SPC. For information retrieval via the international PSTN/ISDN signalling network, the Global title must be derived from the IMSI, using the principles contained in CCITT Recommendation E.214 and the Numbering Plan Indicator (NPI) value referenced by the SCCP Specifications. A summary of the translation from the IMSI (CCITT Recommendation E.212) to Mobile Global Title (described in CCITT Recommendation E.214) is shown below:
-	E.212 Mobile Country Code translates to E.164 Country Code;
-	E.212 Mobile Network Code translates to E.164 National Destination Code;
-	E.212 Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) is carried unchanged if within the E.164 number maximum length (15 digits). If the Mobile Global Title is more than 15 digits the number is truncated to 15 by deleting the least significant digits.
This translation will be done either at the application or at SCCP level in the GGSN. The Mobile Global Title thus derived will be used to address the HLR.
6.1.3.3.6	Before GPRS location updating completion
When an MS registers for the first time in an SGSN, the SGSN has to initiate the update location dialogue with the MS's HLR and a preceding dialogue for authentication information retrieval if the authentication information must be retrieved from the HLR. When initiating either of these dialogues, the only data for addressing the HLR that the SGSN has available is contained in the IMSI, and addressing information for SCCP must be derived from it. When continuing the established update location dialogue (as with any other dialogue), the SGSN must derive the routeing information towards the HLR from the Calling Party Address received with the first responding CONTINUE message until the dialogue terminating message is received. This means that the SGSN must be able to address the HLR based on:
-	an E.214 (if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used) or E.212 (if ANSI SCCP is used) Mobile Global Title originally derived by the SGSN from the IMSI; or
-	an E.164 HLR address; or
-	in the case of intra-PLMN signalling, an SPC.
If the HLR is in the same PLMN as the SGSN, local translation tables may exist to derive an SPC. For authentication information retrieval and location updating via the international PSTN/ISDN signalling network, the Global title must be derived from the IMSI, using the principles contained in CCITT Recommendation E.214 and the Numbering Plan Indicator (NPI) value referenced by the SCCP Specifications. A summary of the translation from the IMSI (CCITT Recommendation E.212) to Mobile Global Title (described in CCITT Recommendation E.214) is shown below:
-	E.212 Mobile Country Code translates to E.164 Country Code;
-	E.212 Mobile Network Code translates to E.164 National Destination Code;
-	E.212 Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) is carried unchanged if within the E.164 number maximum length (15 digits). If the Mobile Global Title is more than 15 digits the number is truncated to 15 by deleting the least significant digits.
This translation will be done either at the application or at SCCP level in the SGSN. The Mobile Global Title thus derived will be used to address the HLR.
6.1.3.3.7	After GPRS location updating completion
In this case, the subscriber's Basic MSISDN has been received from the HLR during the subscriber data retrieval procedure as well as the HLR number constituting a parameter of the MAP message indicating successful completion of the update location dialogue. From either of these E.164 numbers the address information for initiating dialogues with the roaming subscriber's HLR can be derived. Also the subscriber's IMSI may be used for establishing the routeing information towards the HLR.
Thus the SCCP address of the roaming subscriber's HLR may be an SPC, or it may be a Global title consisting of the E.164 MSISDN or the E.164 number allocated to the HLR or the E.214 Mobile Global Title derived from the IMSI.
6.1.3.3.8	Query for a Location Request
For a location request from an external client, the GMLC needs to address the home HLR of the target MS to obtain the address of the target MS's serving MSC. The GMLC uses either the international E.164 MSISDN, the international E.214 number (if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used) or the international E.212 number (if ANSI SCCP is used) of the MS as means to route a query to the HLR.
6.1.3.4	The Visitor Location Register (VLR)
6.1.3.4.0	General
There are several cases when the VLR needs to be addressed.
6.1.3.4.1	Inter-VLR information retrieval
When an MS moves from one VLR service area to another, the new VLR may request the IMSI and authentication sets from the previous VLR. The new VLR derives the address of the previous VLR from the Location Area Identification provided by the MS in the location registration request.
6.1.3.4.2	HLR request
The HLR will only request information from a VLR if it is aware that one of its subscribers is in the VLR service area. This means that a location updating dialogue initiated by the VLR has been successfully completed, i.e. the HLR has indicated successful completion of the update location procedure to the VLR.
When initiating dialogues towards the VLR after successful completion of location updating, the routeing information used by the HLR is derived from the E.164 VLR number received as a parameter of the MAP message initiating the update location dialogue. If the VLR is in the same PLMN as the HLR, the VLR may be addressed directly by an SPC derived from the E.164 VLR number. For dialogues via the international PSTN/ISDN signalling network, presence of the E.164 VLR number in the Called Party Address is required.
6.1.3.4.3	CSS request
The CSS will only request information from a VLR if it is aware that one of its subscribers is in the VLR service area. This means that a VCSG location updating dialogue initiated by the VLR has been successfully completed, i.e. the CSS has indicated successful completion of the update VCSG location procedure to the VLR.
When initiating dialogues towards the VLR after successful completion of VCSG location updating, the routeing information used by the CSS is derived from the E.164 VLR number received as a parameter of the MAP message initiating the update VCSG location dialogue. The VLR may be addressed either by the E.164 VLR number or directly by an SPC derived from the E.164 VLR number due to the VLR is in the same PLMN as the CSS.
6.1.3.5	The Interworking MSC (IWMSC) for Short Message Service
The IWMSC is the interface between the mobile network and the network to access to the Short Message Service Centre. This exchange has an E.164 address known in the SGSN or in the MSC.
6.1.3.6	The Equipment Identity Register (EIR)
The EIR address is either unique or could be derived from the IMEI. The type of address is not defined.
6.1.3.7	Void
6.1.3.8	The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)
6.1.3.8.0	General
There are several cases when the SGSN needs to be addressed.
6.1.3.8.1	HLR request
The HLR will initiate dialogues towards the SGSN if it is aware that one of its subscribers is in the SGSN serving area. This means that a GPRS location updating has been successfully completed, i.e., the HLR has indicated successful completion of the GPRS location update to the SGSN. The routeing information used by the HLR is derived form the E.164 SGSN number received as parameter of the MAP message initiating the GPRS update location procedure. If the SGSN is in the same PLMN as the HLR, the SGSN may be addressed directly by an SPC derived from the E.164 SGSN number. For dialogues via the international PSTN/ISDN signalling network, the presence of the E.164 SGSN number in the Called Party Address is required.
6.1.3.8.2	GMSC request
When the GMSC initiates dialogues towards the SGSN the SGSN (MAP) SSN (See 3GPP TS 23.003 [17]) shall be included in the called party address. The routeing information used by the GMSC is derived from the E.164 SGSN number received as a parameter of the MAP message initiating the forward short message procedure. If the GMSC does not support the GPRS functionality the MSC (MAP) SSN value shall be included in the called party address.
NOTE:	Every VMSC and SGSN shall have uniquely identifiable application using E.164 numbers, for the purpose of SMS over GPRS when the GMSC does not support the GPRS functionality.
6.1.3.8.3	CSS request
The CSS will initiate dialogues towards the SGSN if it is aware that one of its subscribers is in the SGSN serving area. This means that a VCSG location updating has been successfully completed, i.e., the CSS has indicated successful completion of the VCSG location update to the SGSN. The routeing information used by the CSS is derived from the E.164 SGSN number received as parameter of the MAP message initiating the update VCSG location procedure. The SGSN may be addressed either by the E.164 SGSN number or directly by an SPC derived from the E.164 SGSN number due to the SGSN is in the same PLMN as the CSS.
6.1.3.9	The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)
The GGSN provides interworking with external packet-switched networks, network screens and routing of the Network-Requested PDP Context activation. If a Network-Requested PDP Context activation fails, the HLR will alert the GGSN when the subscriber becomes reachable. The HLR will use the E.164 GGSN number received as parameter of the MAP message reporting the failure.
6.1.3.10	The Gateway MSC (GMSC) for Short Message Service
The GMSC provides interworking with the network to access the Short Message Service Centre, the mobile network and routing of Send Routing Info For SM. The GMSC has on E.164 address known in the HLR, SGSN or MSC.
6.1.3.10A	Void
6.1.3.10A.1	Void
6.1.3.10A.2	Void
6.1.3.10B	The Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC)
The GMLC initiates location requests on behalf of external clients. The E.164 address of the GMLC is provided to an HLR when the GMLC requests a serving MSC address or SGSN address from the HLR for a target MS. The E.164 address of the GMLC is also provided to a serving MSC or SGSN when the GMLC requests the location of a target MS served by this MSC or SGSN.
6.1.3.10C	The CSG Subscriber Server (CSS)
The CSS address is either unique or could be derived from the IMSI. The type of address is not defined.
6.1.3.11	Summary table
The following tables summarise the SCCP address used for invoke operations. As a principle, within a PLMN either an SPC or a GT may be used (network operation option), whereas when addressing an entity outside the PLMN the GT must be used. The address type mentioned in the table (e.g. MSISDN) is used as GT or to derive the SPC.
For a response, the originating address passed in the invoke is used as SCCP Called Party Address. For extra-PLMN addressing the own E.164 entity address is used as SCCP Calling Party Address; for intra-PLMN addressing an SPC derived from the entity number may be used instead. When using an SPC, the SPC may be taken directly from MTP.

NOTE:	For initiating the location updating procedure and an authentication information retrieval from the HLR preceding it, the VLR has to derive the HLR address from the IMSI of the MS. The result can be an SPC or an E.214 Mobile Global Title if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used, or IMSI itself if ANSI SCCP is used (ANSI SCCP is used in World Zone 1). When continuing the established update location dialogue (as with any other dialogue) the VLR must derive the routeing information towards the HLR from the Calling Party Address received with the first responding CONTINUE message until the dialogue terminating message is received.
	For transactions invoked by the VLR after update location completion, the VLR may derive the information for addressing the HLR from addresses received in the course of the update location procedure (MSISDN or HLR number) or from the IMSI.
	When invoking the Restore Data procedure and an authentication information retrieval from the HLR preceding it, the VLR must derive the information for addressing the HLR from the address information received in association with the roaming number request. This may be either the IMSI received as a parameter of the MAP message requesting the Roaming Number or the Calling Party Address associated with the MAP message requesting the Roaming Number.
	The gsmSCF shall be addressed using more than one Global Title number. The first Global Title number is used to address a gsmSCF for MAP. The second Global Title number is used to address a gsmSCF for CAP.
	For querying the HLR to obtain the VMSC address to support location services, the GMLC has to derive the HLR address from either the MSISDN or IMSI of the target MS. When using the IMSI, the result can be an SPC or an E.214 Mobile Global Title if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used, or IMSI itself if ANSI SCCP is used (ANSI SCCP is used in World Zone 1).

6.2	Use of TC
The Mobile Application part makes use of the services offered by the Transaction Capabilities (TC) of Signalling System No. 7. ETS 300 287, which is based on CCITT White Book Recommendations Q.771 to Q.775, should be consulted for the full specification of TC.
The MAP uses all the services provided by TC except the ones related to the unstructured dialogue facility.
From a modelling perspective, the MAP is viewed as a single Application Service Element. Further structuring of it is for further study.
Transaction Capabilities refers to a protocol structure above the network layer interface (i.e., the SCCP service interface) up to the application layer including common application service elements but not the specific application service elements using them.
TC is structured as a Component sub-layer above a Transaction sub-layer.
The Component sub-layer provides two types of application services: services for the control of end-to-end dialogues and services for Remote Operation handling. These services are accessed using the TC-Dialogue handling primitives and TC-Component handling primitives respectively.
Services for dialogue control include the ability to exchange information related to application-context negotiation as well as initialisation data.
Services for Remote Operation handling provide for the exchange of protocol data units invoking tasks (operations), and reporting their outcomes (results or errors) plus any non-application-specific protocol errors detected by the component sub-layer. The reporting of application-specific protocol errors by the TC user, as distinct from application process errors, is also provided. The Transaction sub-layer provides a simple end-to-end connection association service over which several related protocol data units (i.e. built by the Component Sub-Layer) can be exchanged. A Transaction termination can be prearranged (no indication provided to the TC user) or basic (indication provided).

7	General on MAP services
7.1	Terminology and definitions
The term service is used in clauses 7 to 12 as defined in CCITT Recommendation X.200. The service definition conventions of CCITT Recommendation X.210 are also used. 
MAP services that are defined for use between HLR and SGSN are also used in an Evolved Packet System (EPS) between two IWFs and between HSS and IWF, where the IWF is an Interworking Function that converts MAP messages to Diameter messages and vice versa. 
MAP services that are defined for use between SGSN and EIR are also used in an Evolved Packet System (EPS) between IWF and EIR.
IWFs may be connected via Diameter to MMEs and HSSs and they may be connected via MAP to HSSs, IWFs, and EIRs.

7.2	Modelling principles
MAP provides its users with a specified set of services and can be viewed by its users as a "black box" or abstract machine representing the MAP service-provider. The service interface can then be depicted as shown in figure 7.2/1.

Figure 7.2/1: Modelling principles
The MAP service-users interact with the MAP service-provider by issuing or receiving MAP service-primitives at the service interface.
A MAP service-user may receive services from several instances of the MAP service-provider at the same time. In such cases the overall procedure is synchronised by the service-user.
The MAP service-primitives are named using the following notation:
MAP-ServicePrimitiveName type
where type can be any of: request (req), indication (ind), response (rsp) or confirm (cnf). (In the user arrow diagrams type is not indicated in the case of req/ind and indicated as "ack" in the case of rsp/cnf).
The services are further classified as unconfirmed-service, confirmed-service and provider-initiated-service where the first two categories refer to whether or not the service is confirmed by the service-provider. The confirmation may or may not correspond to a response provided by the other service-user.
MAP services are also classified as common MAP services that are available to all MAP service-users, and MAP service-user specific services, which are services available to one or several, but not all, MAP service-users.
A MAP dialogue is defined as an exchange of information between two MAP users in order to perform a common task. A MAP dialogue will consist of one or several MAP services.
7.3	Common MAP services
All MAP service-users require access to services for performing basic application layer functions:
-	for establishing and clearing MAP dialogues between peer MAP service-users;
-	for accessing functions supported by layers below the applications layer;
-	for reporting abnormal situations;
-	for handling of different MAP versions;
-	for testing whether or not a persistent MAP dialogue is still active at each side.
For these purposes the following common services are defined:
-	MAP-OPEN service;
-	MAP-CLOSE service;
-	MAP-DELIMITER service;
-	MAP-U-ABORT service;
-	MAP-P-ABORT service;
-	MAP-NOTICE service.
In defining the service-primitives the following convention is used for categorising parameters:
M	the inclusion of the parameter is mandatory. The M category can be used for any primitive type and specifies that the corresponding parameter must be present in the indicated primitive type;
O	the inclusion of the parameter is a service-provider option. The O category can be used in indication and confirm type primitives and is used for parameters that may optionally be included by the service-provider;
U	the inclusion of the parameter is a service-user option. The U category can be used in request and response type primitives. The inclusion of the corresponding parameter is the choice of the service-user;
C	the inclusion of the parameter is conditional. The C category can be used for the following purposes:
-	to indicate that if the parameter is received from another entity it must be included for the service being considered;
-	to indicate that the service user must decide whether to include the parameter, based on the context on which the service is used;
-	to indicate that one of a number of mutually exclusive parameters must be included (e.g. parameters indicating a positive result versus parameters indicating a negative result);
-	to indicate that a service user optional parameter (marked "U") or a conditional parameter (marked "C") presented by the service user in a request or response type primitive is to be presented to the service user in the corresponding indication or confirm type primitive;
(=)	when appended to one of the above, this symbol means that the parameter takes the same value as the parameter appearing immediately to its left;
blank	the parameter is not present.
A primitive type may also be without parameters, i.e. no parameter is required with the primitive type; in this case the corresponding column of the table is empty.
7.3.1	MAP-OPEN service
This service is used for establishing a MAP dialogue between two MAP service-users. The service is a confirmed service with service primitives as shown in table 7.3/1.

Application context name:
This parameter identifies the type of application context being established. If the dialogue is accepted the received application context name shall be echoed. In case of refusal of dialogue this parameter shall indicate the highest version supported.
Destination address:
A valid SCCP address identifying the destination peer entity (see also clause 6). As an implementation option, this parameter may also, in the indication, be implicitly associated with the service access point at which the primitive is issued.
Destination-reference:
This parameter is a reference that refines the identification of the called process. It may be identical to Destination address but its value is to be carried at MAP level. Table 7.3/2 describes the MAP services using this parameter. Only these services are allowed to use it.

NOTE 3:	Only when the IMSI and the LMSI are received together from the HLR in the mobile terminated short message transfer.
Originating address:
A valid SCCP address identifying the requestor of a MAP dialogue (see also clause 6). As an implementation option, this parameter may also, in the request, be implicitly associated with the service access point at which the primitive is issued.
Originating-reference:
This parameter is a reference that refines the identification of the calling process. It may be identical to the Originating address but its value is to be carried at MAP level. Table 7.3/3 describes the MAP services using the parameter. Only these services are allowed to use it. Processing of the Originating-reference shall be performed according to the supplementary service descriptions and other service descriptions, e.g. operator determined barring. Furthermore the receiving entity may be able to use the value of the Originating-reference to screen the service indication.

7.3.8	Void
7.3.9	Void
7.3.10	Void
7.4	Sequencing of services
The sequencing of services is shown in figure 7.4/1 and is as follows:
Opening:
	The MAP-OPEN service is invoked before any user specific service-primitive is accepted. The sequence may contain none, one or several user specific service-primitives. If no user specific service-primitive is contained between the MAP-OPEN and the MAP-DELIMITER primitives, then this will correspond to sending an empty Begin message in TC. If more than one user specific service-primitive is included, all are to be sent in the same Begin message. The sequence ends with a MAP-DELIMITER primitive.
Continuing:
	This sequence may not be present in some MAP dialogues. If it is present, it ends with a MAP-DELIMITER primitive. If more than one user specific service-primitive is included, all are to be included in the same Continue message.
Closing:
	The sequence can only appear after an opening sequence or a continuing sequence. The sequence may contain none, one or several user specific service-primitives if the MAP-CLOSE primitive specifies normal release. If no user specific service-primitive is included, then this will correspond to sending an empty End message in TC. If more than one user specific service-primitive is included, all are to be sent in the same End message. If prearranged end is specified, the sequence cannot contain any user specific service-primitive. The MAP-CLOSE primitive must be sent after all user specific service-primitives have been delivered to the MAP service-provider.
Aborting:
	A MAP service-user can issue a MAP-U-ABORT primitive at any time after the MAP dialogue has been opened or as a response to an attempt to open a MAP dialogue.
The MAP service-provider may issue at any time a MAP-P-ABORT primitive towards a MAP service-user for which a MAP dialogue exists.
MAP-U-ABORT primitives and MAP-P-ABORT primitives terminate the MAP dialogue.

a) Opening

b) Continuing

c) Closing

d) Aborting
Figure 7.4/1: Sequencing of services
If the reason "resource unavailable (short term problem)" is indicated in the MAP-U-ABORT indication primitive, the MAP service-user may decide to attempt a new MAP dialogue establishment immediately.
Sequencing of user specific service-primitives is done by the MAP service-user and based on rules applicable for each MAP service-user instance.
A MAP-NOTICE indication primitive may be received at any time during the active period of a MAP dialogue.
7.5	General rules for mapping of services onto TC
7.5.1	Mapping of common services
Table 7.5/1 gives an overview of the mapping rules for mapping of common services onto TC-services. Table 7.5/2 gives the mapping rules for mapping of TC-services onto common services.

7.6	Definition of parameters
7.6.1	Common parameters
The following set of parameters is used in several MAP service-primitives.
7.6.1.1	Invoke Id
This parameter identifies corresponding service primitives. The parameter is supplied by the MAP service-user and must be unique over each service-user/service-provider interface.
7.6.1.2	Linked Id
This parameter is used for linked services and it takes the value of the invoke Id of the service linked to.
7.6.1.3	Provider error
This parameter is used to indicate a protocol related type of error:
-	duplicated invoke Id;
-	not supported service;
-	mistyped parameter;
-	resource limitation;
-	initiating release, i.e. the peer has already initiated release of the dialogue and the service has to be released;
-	unexpected response from the peer;
-	service completion failure;
-	no response from the peer;
-	invalid response received.
7.6.1.4	User error
This parameter can take values as follows:
NOTE:	The values are grouped in order to improve readability; the grouping has no other significance.
a)	Generic error:
-	system failure, i.e. a task cannot be performed because of a problem in the entity reporting the error or in another entity. The type of entity or network resource may be indicated by use of the network resource parameter or additional network resource parameter. If and only if the problem is in the entity reporting the error, a cause of failure (FailureCauseParam) shall be included;
-	data missing, i.e. an optional parameter required by the context is missing;
-	unexpected data value, i.e. the data type is formally correct but its value or presence is unexpected in the current context;
-	resource limitation;
-	initiating release, i.e. the receiving entity has started the release procedure;
-	facility not supported, i.e. the requested facility is not supported by the PLMN with detailed reasons as follows:
	-	Shape of location estimate not supported;
	-	Needed LCS capability not supported in serving node;
-	incompatible terminal, i.e. the requested facility is not supported by the terminal.
b)	Identification or numbering problem:
-	unknown subscriber, i.e. no such subscription exists;
-	number changed, i.e. the subscription does not exist for that number any more;
-	unknown MSC;
-	unidentified subscriber, i.e. if the subscriber is not contained in the database and it has not or cannot be established whether or not a subscription exists;
-	unallocated roaming number;
-	unknown equipment;
-	unknown location area.
c)	Subscription problem:
-	roaming not allowed, i.e. a location updating attempt is made in an area not covered by the subscription;
-	illegal subscriber, i.e. illegality of the access has been established by use of authentication procedure;
-	bearer service not provisioned;
-	teleservice not provisioned;
-	illegal equipment, i.e. the IMEI check procedure has shown that the IMEI is blacklisted or not whitelisted.
d)	Handover problem:
-	no handover number available, i.e. the VLR cannot allocate a number for handover or cannot allocate the required amount of numbers for relocation;
-	subsequent handover failure, i.e. handover to a third MSC failed for some reason;
-	target cell outside group call area.
e)	Operation and maintenance problem:
-	tracing buffer full, i.e. tracing cannot be performed because the tracing capacity is exceeded.
f)	Call set-up problem:
-	no roaming number available, i.e. a roaming number cannot be allocated because all available numbers are in use;
-	absent subscriber, i.e. the subscriber has activated the detach service or the system detects the absence condition. This error may be qualified to indicate whether the subscriber was IMSI detached, in a restricted area or did not respond to paging;
-	busy subscriber. This error may be qualified to indicate that the subscriber was busy due to CCBS and that CCBS is possible;
-	no subscriber reply;
-	forwarding violation, i.e. the call has already been forwarded the maximum number of times that is allowed;
-	CUG reject, i.e. the call does not pass a CUG check; additional information may also be given in order to indicate rejection due to e.g. incoming call barred or non-CUG membership;
-	call barred. Optionally, additional information may be included for indicating either that the call meets a barring condition set by the subscriber or that the call is barred for operator reasons. In the case of barring of Mobile Terminating Short Message, the additional information may indicate a barring condition due to "Unauthorised Message Originator"; if the call is rejected due to the application of the ACR supplementary service, the additional information shall indicate a barring condition due to "Anonymous Call Rejection";
-	optimal routeing not allowed, i.e. the entity which sends the error does not support optimal routeing, or the HLR will not accept an optimal routeing interrogation from the GMSC, or the call cannot be optimally routed because it would contravene optimal routeing constraints;
-	forwarding failed, i.e. the GMSC interrogated the HLR for forwarding information but the HLR returned an error.
g)	Supplementary services problem:
-	call barred;
-	illegal SS operation;
-	SS error status;
-	SS not available;
-	SS subscription violation;
-	SS incompatibility;
-	negative password check;
-	password registration failure;
-	Number of Password Attempts;
-	USSD Busy;
-	Unknown Alphabet;
-	short term denial;
-	long term denial.
For definition of these errors see 3GPP TS 24.080 [38].
h)	Short message problem:
-	SM delivery failure with detailed reason as follows:
-	memory capacity exceeded;
-	MS protocol error;
-	MS not equipped;
-	unknown service centre (SC);
-	SC congestion;
-	invalid SME address;
-	subscriber is not an SC subscriber;
-	and possibly detailed diagnostic information, coded as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040, under SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT and SMS-DELIVERY-REPORT. If the SM entity that returns the SM Delivery Failure error includes detailed diagnostic information, it shall be forwarded in the MAP_MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE and in the MAP_MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE response.
-	message waiting list full, i.e. no further SC address can be added to the message waiting list.
-	Subscriber busy for MT SMS, i.e. the mobile terminated short message transfer cannot be completed because:
-	another mobile terminated short message transfer is going on and the delivery node does not support message buffering; or 
-	another mobile terminated short message transfer is going on and it is not possible to buffer the message for later delivery; or
-	the message was buffered but it is not possible to deliver the message before the expiry of the buffering time defined in 3GPP TS 23.040;
-	Absent Subscriber SM, i.e. the mobile terminated short message transfer cannot be completed because the network cannot contact the subscriber. Diagnostic information regarding the reason for the subscriber's absence may be included with this error.
i)	Location services problem:
-	Unauthorised Requesting Network
-	Unauthorised LCS Client with detailed reasons as follows:
-	NoAdditional Information
-	Client not in MS Privacy Exception List
-	Call to Client not setup
-	Disallowed by Local Regulatory Requirements

8.1.2.3	Parameter definitions and use
Invoke Id
See definition in clause 7.6.1.
IMSI
See definition in clause 7.6.2.
MSC Address
See definition for MSC number in clause 7.6.2. The MSC address is used for short message delivery only and for each incoming call set-up attempt the MSRN will be requested from the VLR.
VLR number
See definition in clause 7.6.2.
LMSI
See definition in clause 7.6.2. It is an operator option to provide the LMSI from the VLR; it is mandatory for the HLR to support the LMSI handling procedures.
Supported CAMEL Phases
This parameter indicates which phases of CAMEL are supported. Must be present if a CAMEL phase different from phase 1 is supported. Otherwise may be absent.
HLR number
See definition in clause 7.6.2. The presence of this parameter is mandatory in case of successful HLR updating.
SoLSA Support Indicator
This parameter is used by the VLR to indicate to the HLR in the Update Location indication that SoLSA is supported. If this parameter is not included in the Update Location indication and the Subscriber is marked as only allowed to roam in Subscribed LSAs, then the HLR shall reject the roaming and indicate to the VLR that roaming is not allowed to that Subscriber in the VLR. 
This SoLSA Support Indicator shall be stored by the HLR per VLR where there are Subscribers roaming. If a Subscriber is marked as only allowed to roam in Subscribed LSAs while roaming in a VLR and no SoLSA Support indicator is stored for that VLR, the location status of that Subscriber shall be set to Restricted.
IST Support Indicator
This parameter is used to indicate to the HLR that the VMSC supports basic IST functionality, that is, the VMSC is able to terminate the Subscriber Call Activity that originated the IST Alert when it receives the IST alert response indicating that the call(s) shall be terminated. If this parameter is not included in the Update Location indication and the Subscriber is marked as an IST Subscriber, then the HLR may limit the service for the subscriber (by inducing an Operator Determined barring of Roaming, Incoming or Outgoing calls), or allow service assuming the associated risk of not having the basic IST mechanism available. 
This parameter can also indicate that the VMSC supports the IST Command service, including the ability to terminate all calls being carried for the identified subscriber by using the IMSI as a key. If this additional capability is not included in the Update Location indication and the HLR supports the IST Command capability, then the HLR may limit the service for the subscriber (by inducing an Operator Determined barring of Roaming, Incoming or Outgoing calls), or allow service assuming the associated risk of not having the IST Command mechanism available.
Long FTN Supported
This parameter indicates that the VLR supports Long Forwarded-to Numbers.
Super-Charger Supported in Serving Network Entity
This parameter is used by the VLR to indicate to the HLR that the VLR supports the Super-Charger functionality and whether subscription data has been retained by the VLR. If subscription data has been retained by the VLR the age indicator shall be included. Otherwise the VLR shall indicate that subscriber data is required.
If this parameter is absent then the VLR does not support the Super-Charger functionality.
Supported LCS Capability Sets
This parameter indicates, if present, the capability sets of LCS which are supported. If the parameter is sent but no capability set is marked as supported then the VLR does not support LCS at all.
If this parameter is absent then the VLR may support at most LCS capability set 1, that is LCS Release98 or Release99 version.
Offered CAMEL 4 CSIs 
This parameter indicates the CAMEL phase 4 CSIs offered in the VMSC/VLR (see clause 7.6.3.36D).
Inform Previous Network Entity
This parameter is used by the VLR to ask the HLR to inform the previous network entity about the update by sending the previous network entity a Cancel Location message. It is used if Super-Charger is supported in the network and either the serving network entity has not been able to inform the previous network entity that MS has moved (i.e. if it has not sent Send Identification to the previous serving entity) or the MTRF Supported flag is set in the MAP_UPDATE LOCATION request.
CS LCS Not Supported by UE
See definition in clause 7.6.11.
V-GMLC address
See definition in clause 7.6.2.
IMEISV
For definition of the parameter see clause 7.6.2. For the use of this parameter see 3GPP TS 23.012. IMEISV shall be present if ADD function is supported and a new IMEISV is to be notified to the HLR (The functional requirements for the presence of IMEISV due to ADD are described in 3GPP TS 22.101 clause 7.4).
Skip Subscriber Data Update
The presence of the parameter is optional and if present it indicates that the service is solely used to inform the HLR about change of IMEISV or Paging Area. The parameter is used to optimise signalling load during Location Update procedure. 
Supported RAT Types Indicator
This parameter indicates, if present, which access technologies (e.g. GERAN and / or UTRAN) are served by the MSC/VLR (see clause 7.6.3)
Paging Area
This parameter indicates, if present, the paging area where the MS is currently located (see clause 7.6.5.18)
Restoration Indicator
This parameter indicates, if present, that the HLR shall send in the MAP-INSERT-SUBSCRIBER-DATA the MME Name if the subscriber is registered to EPS, or the SGSN Number if available and if the subscriber is registered to GPRS. The VLR may set this indicator during a CSFB mobile originated call if the VLR performs an implicit location update (see 3GPP TS 23.272 [143]).
MTRF Supported
See 3GPP TS 23.018 [97] and 3GPP TS 23.012 [23] for the use of this parameter and the conditions for its presence.
Equivalent PLMN List
This parameter indicates the equivalent PLMN list of which the VLR requests the corresponding CSG Subscription data.
MSISDN-less Operation Supported
See clause 3.6.1.5 of 3GPP TS 23.012 [23] for the use of this parameter and the conditions for its presence.
MME-Diameter-Address-For-MT-SMS
This parameter may be sent by an IWF that registers an MME for MT-SMS. The MME-Diameter-Address-For-MT-SMS may be stored in the HLR and may be sent in SMS interrogation responses to SMS-GMSCs.
Reset-IDs Supported
This parameter indicates, if present, the support of Reset-IDs by the MSC.
ADD Capability
This parameter indicates, if present, the support of ADD function by the HLR.
Paging Area Capability
This parameter indicates, if present, the support of Paging Area function by the HLR. The HLR shall report the same capability for all subscribers.
User error
In case of unsuccessful updating, an error cause shall be returned by the HLR. The following error causes defined in clause 7.6.1 may be used, depending on the nature of the fault:
-	unknown subscriber;
-	roaming not allowed;
	This cause will be sent if the MS is not allowed to roam into the PLMN indicated by the VLR number. The cause is qualified by the roaming restriction reason "PLMN Not Allowed", "Supported RAT Types Not Allowed" or "Operator Determined Barring". If no qualification is received (HLR with MAP Version 1), "PLMN Not Allowed" is taken as default.
	This cause shall be used when the HLR rejects a MAP Update Location request received for an MSISDN-less subscription from a VLR not supporting MSISDN-less operation (see clause 3.6.1.5 of 3GPP TS 23.012 [23]).
-	system failure;
-	unexpected data value.
Provider error
For definition of provider errors see clause 7.6.1.
8.1.3	MAP_CANCEL_LOCATION service
8.1.3.1	Definition
This service is used between HLR and VLR to delete a subscriber record from the VLR. It may be invoked automatically when an MS moves from one VLR area to another, to remove the subscriber record from the old VLR, or by the HLR operator to enforce a location updating from the VLR to the HLR, e.g. on withdrawal of a subscription.
Also this service is used between HLR and SGSN to delete a subscriber record from the SGSN. It may be invoked automatically when an MS moves from one SGSN area to another, to remove the subscriber record from the old SGSN, or by the HLR operator to enforce a location updating from the SGSN to the HLR. This service is also used to request the SGSN to indicate to the MS to initiate an immediate re-attach procedure.
In an EPS this service is used between HSS and IWF and between IWF and IWF to delete the subscriber record from the MME or SGSN or to release bearer resources without deleting the subscriber record. This service is also used to request the MME or SGSN to indicate to the UE to initiate an immediate re-attach procedure.
The MAP_CANCEL_LOCATION service is a confirmed service using the primitives defined in table 8.1/3.

8.8	Subscriber management services
8.8.1	MAP-INSERT-SUBSCRIBER-DATA service
8.8.1.1	Definition
This service is used by an HLR to update a VLR with certain subscriber data in the following occasions:
-	the operator has changed the subscription of one or more supplementary services, basic services or data of a subscriber. Note that in case of withdrawal of a Basic or Supplementary service this primitive shall not be used;
-	the operator has applied, changed or removed Operator Determined Barring;
-	the subscriber has changed data concerning one or more supplementary services by using a subscriber procedure;
-	the HLR provides the VLR with subscriber parameters at location updating of a subscriber or at restoration. In this case, this service is used to indicate explicitly that a supplementary service is not provisioned, if the supplementary service specification requires it. The only supplementary services which have this requirement are the CLIR and COLR services. Network access mode is provided only in restoration. If the Super-Charger functionality is supported the HLR may not need to provide the VLR with subscriber parameters at location updating of a subscriber. See TS 23.116.
Also this service is used by an HLR to update an SGSN with certain subscriber data in the following occasions:
-	if the GPRS subscription has changed;
-	if the network access mode is changed;
-	the operator has applied, changed or removed Operator Determined Barring;
-	the subscriber has changed data concerning one or more supplementary services by using a subscriber procedure;
-	the HLR provides the SGSN with subscriber parameters at GPRS location updating of a subscriber. If the Super‑Charger functionality is supported the HLR may not need to provide the SGSN with subscriber parameters. See 3GPP TS 23.116. 
Also this service is used by a CSS to update an SGSN or a VLR with VPLMN-CSG-Subscription data in the following occasions:
-	if the VPLMN-CSG subscription data has changed;
-	the CSS provides the VLR or SGSN with VPLMN-CSG subscription data at VCSG location updating of a subscriber.

In an EPS, this service is used by an HSS to update an MME via IWF with certain subscriber data in the following occasions:
-	the EPS subscription has changed;
-	the operator has applied, changed or removed Operator Determined Barring;
-	the HSS provides the MME via IWF(MME) with subscriber parameters at EPS location updating of a subscriber unless an explicit indication to skip subscriber data update has been received.
In an EPS, this service is used by an IWF to indicate to the MME via IWF that the HSS has requested to be notified when the UE has become reachable.
It is a confirmed service and consists of the primitives shown in table 8.8/1.

All parameters are described in clause 7.6. The following clarifications are applicable:
Network access mode
This parameter defines if the subscriber has access to MSC/VLR and/or to SGSN/MME. This parameter is used by SGSN/MME and MSC/VLR. In VLR, the parameter is used only as part of Restore Data Procedure and the parameter is not stored in the VLR. This parameter shall always be sent to the SGSN and viaIWF to the MME as part of the GPRS subscriber data at GPRS/MME location updating. It shall be sent to the SGSN and via IWF to the MME if it is changed as a result of administrative action. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.

IMSI
It is only included if the service is not used in an ongoing transaction (e.g. location updating). This parameter is used by the VLR and the SGSN and IWF.
MSISDN
For subscriptions with MSISDN:
It is included at location updating and when it is changed. The MSISDN sent shall be the basic MSISDN. This parameter is used by the VLR and the SGSN and IWF.
For a subscription without MSISDN:
The HLR shall not populate this parameter  if the VLR or SGSN explicitly indicated support of MSISDN-less operation. 
NOTE 1:	See clauses 8.1.2.3 and 8.1.7.3 for the case where the VLR or SGSN does not support MSISDN-less operation.
Additional MSISDN
If subscribed, the Additional MSISDN is included at location updating and when it is changed. This parameter is used by the SGSN and IWF. This parameter shall be ignored by the VLR if received.
If the SGSN does not indicate support of the feature the HSS shall not send the parameter.
Category
It is included either at location updating or when it is changed. This parameter is used only by the VLR and if the SGSN or IWF receives this parameter it shall ignore it.
Subscriber Status
It is included either at location updating or when it is changed.
To apply, remove or update Operator Determined Barring Categories the Subscriber Status is set to Operator Determined Barring. In this case ODB General Data shall also be present. If the Operator Determined Barring applies and the subscriber is registered in the HPLMN and HPLMN specific Operator Determined Barring applies then ODB HPLMN Specific Data shall also be present.
To remove all Operator Determined Barring Categories the Subscriber Status shall be set to "Service Granted". This parameter is used by the VLR and the SGSN and IWF. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.

Bearer service List
A list of Extensible Bearer service parameters (Extensible Bearer service is defined in clause 7.6). An Extensible Bearer service parameter must be the code for an individual Bearer service, except in the cases described below.
The codes for the Bearer service groups "allAlternateSpeech-DataCDA" and "allAlternateSpeech-DataCDS" shall, if applicable, be sent from the HLR to the VLR as a pair. The codes for the Bearer service groups "allSpeechFollowedByDataCDA" and "allSpeechFollowedByDataCDS" shall, if applicable, be sent from the HLR to the VLR as a pair.
If it is included in the Request/Indication, it includes either all Extensible Bearer services subscribed (at location updating or at restoration) or only the ones added (at subscriber data modification).
If the VLR receives an Indication containing any Extensible Bearer service parameters which it does not support/allocate it returns them in the response to the HLR and discards the unsupported Extensible Bearer services (no error is sent back), except in the cases described below.
If the VLR receives the codes for the Bearer service groups "allSpeechFollowedByDataCDA" and "allSpeechFollowedByDataCDS" and supports one or more of the circuit-switched synchronous or asynchronous data rates specified for simple data bearer services, it shall accept the bearer service codes, and not return them in the response to the HLR. If the VLR does not support any of the circuit-switched synchronous or asynchronous data rates specified for simple data bearer services, and receives the pair of codes for "allAlternateSpeech-DataCDA" and "allAlternateSpeech-DataCDS" or the pair of codes for "allSpeechFollowedByDataCDA" and "allSpeechFollowedByDataCDS", it shall reject the pair of codes by returning them in the response to the HLR. This parameter is used only by the VLR and if the SGSN or IWF receives this parameter it shall ignore it. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.

The Extensible Forwarding Feature may include an Extensible Basic Service Group. This shall be interpreted according to the rules in clause 8.8.1.4.
The Extensible Forwarding Feature shall contain an Extensible SS-Status parameter.
If the Extensible SS-Status indicates that call forwarding is registered then (except for call forwarding unconditional) the Extensible Forwarding Feature shall contain a number to define the forwarded-to destination and, if available, the forwarded-to subaddress. In other states the forwarded-to number and, if applicable, the forwarded-to subaddress shall not be included. For call forwarding unconditional the forwarded-to number and, if applicable, the forwarded-to subaddress shall not be included. If the VLR does not receive a forwarded-to subaddress then it shall assume that a forwarded-to subaddress has not been registered.

For call forwarding services other than call forwarding on no reply: The Extensible Forwarding Feature shall not contain a no reply condition timer.
If the VLR receives an Indication containing any Call Forwarding service codes which it does not support/allocate it returns them to the HLR in the parameter SS-Code List and discards the unsupported Call Forwarding service codes (no error is sent back). This parameter is used only by the VLR and if the SGSN or IWF receives this parameter it shall ignore it. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.

Call barring information List
A list of Extensible Call barring information parameters (Extensible Call barring information is defined in clause 7.6). It includes Call Barring services either at location updating or at restoration or when they are changed.

The Extensible Call barring information shall include the SS-Code for an individual call barring supplementary service. The Extensible Call barring information shall contain one or more Extensible Call Barring Features (Extensible Call Barring Feature is defined in clause 7.6).
The Extensible Call Barring Feature may include an Extensible Basic Service Group. This shall be interpreted according to the rules in clause 8.8.1.4.
The Extensible Call Barring Feature shall contain an extensible SS-Status parameter.
If the VLR or the SGSN or the IWF receives an Indication containing any Extensible Call Barring service codes which it does not support/allocate it returns them to the HLR in the parameter SS-Code List and discards the unsupported Extensible Call Barring service codes (no error is sent back). 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
CUG information List
A list of CUG information list parameters (CUG information is defined in clause 7.6). It includes CUG information either at location updating or at restoration or when it is changed.
At location updating, restoration or when there is a change in CUG data, the HLR shall include the complete CUG‑SubscriptionList and, if there are options per basic group, it shall also include the complete CUG-FeatureList. If there are not options per extensible basic service group the CUG-FeatureList shall not be included.
In any dialogue, the first insertSubscriberData message which contains CUG information shall include a non-empty CUG-SubscriptionList.
When the VLR receives CUG data it shall replace the stored CUG data with the received data set.
If CUG-FeatureList is omitted in the Insert Subscriber Data operation VLR shall interpret that no options per extensible basic service group exist, and then it shall apply the default values i.e. no outgoing access, no incoming access, no preferential CUG exists.
If CUG-Feature is received without preferential CUG, the VLR shall interpret that no preferential CUG applies.
If the VLR detects that there is overlapping in the information received within a dialogue, it shall send the error Unexpected Data Value.
Note that data consistency between CUG subscription data and CUG feature data is the responsibility of the HLR.
If the VLR does not support the CUG service it returns its code to the HLR in the parameter SS-Code List and discards the received information (no error is sent back). This parameter is used only by the VLR and if the SGSN or IWF receives this parameter it shall ignore it. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
SS-Data List
A list of Extensible SS-Data parameters (Extensible SS-Data is defined in clause 7.6). It is sent for any other supplementary service than Call Forwarding, Call Barring, CUG and eMLPP either at location updating or at restoration or when they are changed. Each SS-Data parameter shall be treated independently of all other parameters in the primitive.
The Extensible SS-Data shall include the SS-Code for an individual supplementary service.
The Extensible SS-Data shall contain an Extensible SS-Status parameter and any subscription options that are applicable to the service defined by the SS-Code.

If the VLR receives an Indication containing any supplementary service codes which it does not support/allocate it returns them to the HLR in the parameter SS-Code List and therefore discards the unsupported service codes received (no error is sent back).
This parameter is used by the SGSN only for LCS. If the SGSN receives an Indication containing any LCS related supplementary service codes which it does not support/allocate it returns them to the HLR in the parameter SS-Code List and therefore discards the unsupported service codes received (no error is sent back). SS-codes not related to the supported LCS capability set shall be discarded. 
If the IWF receives an Indication containing any LCS related supplementary service codes, it returns them to the HSS in the parameter SS-Code List and therefore discards the service codes received (no error is sent back). SS-codes not related to the supported LCS capability set shall be discarded. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
Operator Determined Barring General data
If it is included in a Request/Indication, it includes all the Operator Determined Barring categories that may be applied to a subscriber registered in any PLMN. This parameter is only included in a Request/Indication when the parameter Subscriber Status is set to the value Operator Determined Barring. Note that all General Operator Determined Barring Categories shall be set to their actual status.
If the VLR or the SGSN or IWF receives an Indication containing Operator Determined Barring General Data which shows that the subscriber is subject to barring not supported / not allocated by the VLR or by the SGSN, it returns Operator Determined Barring General Data in the response to the HLR to show the barring categories which are not supported / not allocated by the VLR or by the SGSN. This parameter is used by the VLR and the SGSN and IWF. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
Operator Determined Barring HPLMN data
It includes all the Operator Determined Barring categories that may be applied only to a subscriber registered in the HPLMN. Therefore, it shall only be transferred to the VLR or to the SGSN or IWF when the subscriber is roaming into the HPLMN and when the parameter Subscriber Status is set to the value Operator Determined Barring. Note that all HPLMN Operator Determined Barring Categories shall be set to their actual status.
If Subscriber Status is set to the value Operator Determined Barring and no Operator Determined Barring HPLMN data is present then the VLR or the SGSN or IWF shall not apply any HPLMN specific ODB services to the subscriber. This parameter is used by the VLR and the SGSN and IWF. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
eMLPP Subscription Data
If included in the Insert Subscriber Data request this parameter defines the priorities the subscriber might apply for a call (as defined in clause 7.6). It contains both subparameters of eMLPP.
If the VLR does not support the eMLPP service it returns its code to the HLR in the parameter SS-Code List and therefore discards the received information (no error is sent back).
eMLPP subscription data that have been stored previously in a subscriber data record in the VLR are completely replaced by the new eMLPP subscription data received in a MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA during either an Update Location or Restore Data procedure or a stand alone Insert Subscriber data procedure. This parameter is used only by the VLR and if the SGSN or IWF receives this parameter it shall ignore it. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
MC Subscription Data
If included in the Insert Subscriber Data request, this parameter provides the MC Subscription Data as defined in clause 7.6.
If the VLR does not support the MC service, it returns its code to the HLR in the parameter SS-Code List and therefore discards the received information (no error is sent back).
MC subscription data that have been stored previously in a subscriber data record in the VLR are completely replaced by the new MC subscription data received in a MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA during either an Update Location or Restore Data procedure or a stand alone Insert Subscriber data procedure. This parameter is used only by the VLR and if the SGSN or IWF receives this parameter it shall ignore it. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
Roaming Restriction Due To Unsupported Feature
The HLR may decide to include this parameter in the request if certain services or features are indicated as not supported by the MSC/VLR (e.g. Advice of Charge Charging Level).
If this parameter is sent to the VLR the MSC area is restricted by the HLR and the VLR. This parameter is used only by the VLR and if the SGSN or the IWF receives this parameter it shall ignore it. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
Regional Subscription Data
If included in the Insert Subscriber Data request this parameter defines the subscriber's subscription area for the addressed VLR, for the addressed SGSN or for the addressed MME (as defined in clause 7.6). It contains the complete list of up to 10 Zone Codes that apply to a subscriber in the currently visited PLMN. The HLR shall send only those Zone Codes which are stored against the CC and NDC of the VLR, the SGSN or the MME to be updated.
NOTE 2:	Support of this parameter is a network operator option and it will not be sent to networks which do not support Regional Subscription.
Regional subscription data that have been stored previously in a subscriber data record in the VLR, in the SGSN or in the MME are completely replaced by the regional subscription data received in an Insert Subscriber Data indication during either an Update Location or Restore Data procedure or a stand alone Insert Subscriber data procedure.
After the regional subscription data are inserted the VLR or the SGSN shall derive whether its location areas are allowed or not. If the whole MSC or SGSN area is restricted it will be reported to HLR by returning the Regional Subscription Response.
The VLR or the SGSN returns a Regional Subscription Response indicating that a problem with the Zone Code has been detected in one of the following cases:
-	Too Many Zone Codes: more than 10 Zone Codes are to be stored in the VLR or in the SGSN.
-	Regional Subscription Not Supported by the VLR or the SGSN.
-	Zone Codes Conflict: the VLR or the SGSN detects that the zone codes indicate conflicting service permission for a location area.
Zone codes which have no mapping to location areas shall be ignored.
If a sequence of MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA services is used during a dialogue, Regional Subscription Data shall be accepted only in one service. Regional Subscription Data received in a subsequent service shall be rejected with the error Unexpected Data Value.
If Regional Subscription Data are not included in any MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA service, there is no restriction of roaming due to Regional Subscription. This parameter is used by the VLR, the SGSN and the IWF. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
Voice Broadcast Data
This parameter contains a list of group id's a user might have subscribed to; (VBS-Data is defined in clause 7.6). It includes VBS information either at location updating or at restoration or when it is changed.
At location updating, restoration or when there is a change in VBS data, the HLR shall include the complete VBS-Data.
When the VLR receives VBS-Data within a dialogue it shall replace the stored VBS-data with the received data set. All subsequent VBS-data received within this dialogue shall be interpreted as add-on data.
If VBS-data is omitted in the Insert Subscriber Data operation the VLR shall keep the previously stored VBS data.
If the VLR detects that there is overlapping in the information received within a dialogue, it shall send the error Unexpected Data Value. This parameter is used only by the VLR and if the SGSN or the IWF receives this parameter it shall ignore it. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
Voice Group Call Data
This parameter contains a list of group id's a user might have subscribed to; see clause 7.6.
At location updating, restoration or when there is a change in VGCS data, the HLR shall include the complete VGCS‑Data.
When the VLR receives VGCS-Data within a dialogue it shall replace the stored VGCS-Data with the received data set. All VGCS-Data received within this dialogue shall be interpreted as add-on data.
If VBCS-Data is omitted in the Insert Subscriber Data operation the VLR shall keep the previously stored VGCS-Data.
If the VLR detects that there is overlapping in the information received within a dialogue, it shall send the error Unexpected Data Value. This parameter is used only by the VLR and if the SGSN or the IWF receives this parameter it shall ignore it. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
North American Equal Access preferred Carrier Id List
A list of the preferred carrier identity codes that are subscribed to.
When the VLR receives this parameter from the HLR, it shall replace the previously stored preferred carrier identity codes with the received ones. It is not possible to delete all the preferred carrier identity codes from the VLR using this service. To delete all the preferred carrier identity codes from the VLR, the HLR shall use the MAP_CANCEL_LOCATION service. 
This parameter shall not be used by the CSS.
LSA Information
If included in the ISD request, this parameter contains a list of localised service area identities a user might have subscribed to together with the priority, the preferential access indicator, the active mode support indicator and active mode indication of each localised service area; see clause 7.6. The access right outside these localised service areas is also indicated. In all cases mentioned below, the LSA information shall only include LSA Data applicable to the VPLMN where the Subscriber is located. The VLR number, received in the MAP-UPDATE_LOCATION primitive, or the SGSN number, received in the MAP_UPDATE_GPRS_LOCATION primitive, can be used, alongside data stored in the HLR, to determine the LSA Data applicable to the VPLMN.

IST Support Indicator
This parameter is used to indicate to the HLR that the GMSC supports basic IST functionality, that is, the GMSC is able to terminate the subscriber call activity that originated the IST Alert when it receives the IST Alert response indicating that the call(s) shall be terminated. If this parameter is not included in the Send Routing Information indication and the subscriber is marked as an IST subscriber, then the HLR may limit the service for the call (by barring the incoming call if it is not subject to forwarding, or suppressing Call Forwarding from the GMSC), or allow the call assuming the associated risk of not having the basic IST mechanism available.
This parameter can also indicate that the GMSC supports the IST Command, including the ability to terminate all calls being carried for the identified subscriber by using the IMSI as a key. If this additional capability is not included in the Send Routing Information indication and the subscriber is marked as an IST subscriber, then the HLR may limit the service for the subscriber (by barring the incoming calls if they are not subject to forwarding, or suppressing Call Forwarding from the GMSC), or allow the incoming calls assuming the associated risk of not having the IST Command mechanism available.

12.4	MAP-READY-FOR-SM service
12.4.1	Definition
This service is used between the MSC and VLR as well as between the VLR and the HLR. The MSC initiates this service if a subscriber indicates memory available situation. The VLR uses the service to indicate this to the HLR.
The VLR initiates this service if a subscriber, whose message waiting flag is active in the VLR, has radio contact in the MSC.
Also this service is used between the SGSN and the HLR. The SGSN initiates this service if a subscriber indicates memory available situation. The SGSN uses the service to indicate this to the HLR.
Also this service is used between the HSS and the MME via an IWF. The MME initiates this service if a subscriber indicates memory available situation. The MME uses the service to indicate this to the HLR.
The SGSN initiates this service if a subscriber, whose message waiting flag is active in the SGSN, has radio contact in the GPRS. 
The MME initiates this service if a subscriber, whose message waiting flag is active in the MME, has radio contact via LTE.
Also this service is used between the external Short Message Gateway (IP-SM-GW) and the HLR. The IP-SM-GW initiates this service if a subscriber indicates memory available situation. The IP-SM-GW uses the service to indicate this to the HLR.
The IP-SM-GW initiates this service if a subscriber, whose message waiting flag is active in the IP-SM-GW, is reachable in IMS.
The MAP-READY-FOR-SM service is a confirmed service using the primitives from table 12.4/1.

14	General
14.1	Overview
Clauses 14 to 17 specify the protocol elements to be used to provide the MAP services described in clause 7.
Clause 15 specifies the elements of procedures for the MAP protocol. Clause 16 specifies the mapping onto TC service primitives. Clause 17 specifies the application contexts, operation packages and abstract syntaxes for the MAP protocol as well as the encoding rules to be applied.
14.2	Underlying services
The MAP protocol relies on the services provided by the Transaction Capabilities (TC) of Signalling System Number No. 7, as referenced in clause 6.
14.3	Model
The MAP Protocol Machine (MAP PM) can be modelled as a collection of service state machines (SSMs) - one per MAP specific service invoked - coordinated by a MAP dialogue control function with its one state machine: MAP dialogue state machine (DSM). There are two types of Service State Machines: Requesting Service State Machines (RSM) and Performing Service State Machines (PSM).
A new invocation of a MAP PM is employed on the receipt of a MAP-OPEN request primitive or a TC-BEGIN indication primitive. Each invocation controls exactly one MAP dialogue. For each MAP specific service invoked during a dialogue, a MAP RSM is created at the requestor's side and a MAP PSM is created at the performer's side.
This modelling is used only to facilitate understanding and the MAP behaviour descriptions and is not intended to suggest any implementation. SDL descriptions are organised according to this model.
How the MAP-service-user and the MAP refer to a MAP dialogue (i.e. a MAP PM invocation) is a local implementation matter.
How TC dialogue identifiers are assigned to a MAP PM invocation is also a local implementation matter.
14.4	Conventions
The behaviour of the MAP PM depends on the application-context-name associated with the dialogue. One major difference is that the MAP requests the transfer of the application-context-name by TC only for those contexts which do not belong to the so-called "version one context set".
The "version one context set" is a set of application-contexts which model the behaviour of a MAP V1 implementation according to the latest phase 1 version of GSM 09.02. This set is defined in clause 15.
The procedures described in clause 15 are used when the application-context-name does not refer to a dialogue between an MSC and its VLR. When the application-context-name refers to a dialogue between an MSC and its VLR the MAP PM procedures are a local implementation matter.
15	Elements of procedure
15.1	Handling of unknown operations
Unknown operations (i.e. a standard operation introduced in a later version of the MAP specification, or a private operation) can be introduced into MAP in a backwards compatible way. This means that the receiver of an unknown operation shall, if the dialogue state allows it, send a TC-REJECT component to the sender of the operation indicating 'unrecognised operation' and continue with the processing of further components or messages exchanged within the dialogue as if the unknown operation had not been received.
The standardised structure of a MAP dialogue shall not be affected by the invocation of unknown operations, i.e. if a dialogue uses only a TC-BEGIN message which is acknowledged by a TC-END message, a TC-CONTINUE message shall not be used to invoke an unknown operation. However the standardised structure of a MAP dialogue may be affected by the rejection of unknown operations, i.e. if a dialogue uses only a TC-BEGIN message which is acknowledged by a TC-END message, a TC-CONTINUE message followed by a TC-END message may be used to carry the rejection of an unknown operation and the response to the standardised operation. The entity which initiated a dialogue whose standardised structure is a TC-BEGIN message which is acknowledged by a TC-END message shall not send any messages in that dialogue after the TC-BEGIN. Note that if the dialogue structure is affected as described in this paragraph the TC-CONTINUE shall include the dialogue portion required to confirm the acceptance of the dialogue.
Unknown operations may be invoked in the following types of message (there is no restriction as to how many unknown operations can be invoked in a message):
-	TC-BEGIN: the component to invoke the unknown operation shall follow the component of the standard operation which is included in this message. 
-	TC-CONTINUE: the component to invoke the unknown operation may be transported as the only component in a stand-alone message or may be grouped with existing operations. In the latter case a specific sequencing of components is not required.
-	TC-END: if the component to invoke the unknown operation is grouped with an existing operation a specific sequencing of components is not required
The TC-REJECT component may be sent in the following messages:
-	TC-CONTINUE or TC-END: either as the only component of the message or grouped with an existing component. The choice is up to the MAP-Service User.
	If the received message contains only unknown operations the MAP-Service User shall send the TC-REJECT components in a TC-CONTINUE message to the peer entity, if the dialogue state allows it.
	If the received message contains unknown operations and standard operations and the standardised structure of the dialogue requires the response to the standard operation to be sent within a TC-END message, then the MAP-Service User may send the response to the standard operations and the TC-REJECT components for the unknown operations in a TC-CONTINUE message followed by a TC-END message. Neither a specific distribution of the components to the TC messages nor a specific sequencing of components is required.
Note that the SDL diagrams of clauses 19 - 25 do not show the report to the MAP-Service User about the reception of the unknown operation. This has been done for simplicity of description; the MAP PM may inform the MAP-Service User.
The sender of the unknown operation shall ensure that there is enough room in the used message for the unknown operation.
15.2	Dialogue establishment
The establishment of a MAP dialogue involves two MAP-service-users: the dialogue-initiator and the dialogue-responder.
This procedure is driven by the following signals:
-	a MAP-OPEN request primitive from the dialogue-initiator;
-	a TC-BEGIN indication primitive occurring at the responding side;
-	a MAP-OPEN response primitive from the dialogue-responder;
-	the first TC-CONTINUE indication primitive occurring at the initiating side;
and under specific conditions:
-	a TC-END indication primitive occurring at the initiating side;
-	a TC-U-ABORT indication primitive occurring at the initiating side;
-	a TC-P-ABORT indication primitive occurring at the initiating side.
One instance of the MAP dialogue state machine runs at the initiating side, and one at the responding side.
15.2.1	Behaviour at the initiating side
The behaviour of the MAP dialogue state machine at the initiating side is defined in sheets 1 – 8 of the process MAP_DSM (figure 15.6/3).
Sheet 3: When the MAP dialogue state machine at the initiating side is waiting for a response from the responding side, a TC-END indication which echoes the AC name which was sent in the TC-BEGIN indicates acceptance of the dialogue. 
Sheet 3: If the dialogue opening is accepted, any components included in the TC-END are processed and passed to the MAP-Service User. The dialogue is closed by sending a MAP-CLOSE to the MAP-Service User.
Sheet 3, sheet 4, sheet 5, sheet 6, sheet 7, sheet 8: when a dialogue is terminated, the MAP dialogue state machine terminates all instances of the Requesting_MAP_SSM which are active for this dialogue.
Sheet 4: A TC-P-ABORT with an abort parameter Incorrect_Transaction_Portion indicates that the responding side does not support a MAP version higher than 1. This triggers a MAP-OPEN confirm indicating that the dialogue is refused, with a refuse reason potential version incompatibility. The MAP-Service User may then decide to retry the dialogue at MAP version 1. 
Sheet 8: When the MAP dialogue state machine at the initiating side is waiting for a response from the responding side, a TC-CONTINUE indication which echoes the AC name which was sent in the TC-BEGIN indicates acceptance of the dialogue. 
Sheet 8: If the dialogue opening is accepted, any components included in the TC-CONTINUE are processed and passed to the MAP-Service User. The dialogue has then reached the established state.
15.2.2	Behaviour at the responding side
The behaviour of the MAP dialogue state machine at the responding side is defined in sheets 0 – 14 of the process MAP_DSM (figure 15.6/3).
Sheet 9: If no application context information is included in the TC-BEGIN indication, this implies a MAP version 1 dialogue. An explicit application context indicating version 1 is treated as abnormal behaviour.
Sheet 11: The v1 application context name which corresponds to a v1 operation is derived using the information in table 15.2/1.

NOTE 1:	These symbolic names refer to the object identifier value defined in clause 17 and allocated to each application-context used for the MAP.
NOTE 2:	The choice between the application contexts is based on the parameters received in the operation.

Sheet 12: If the dialogue is accepted, each component present in the TC-BEGIN is forwarded to an instance of a Performing_MAP_SSM, by executing the procedure Process_Components.
Sheet 13: If the MAP dialogue state machine receives a MAP-OPEN response with a result accepted, it waits for any MAP specific service request or response primitives or a MAP-DELIMITER request. 
Sheet 13, sheet 14: When a dialogue is terminated, the MAP dialogue state machine terminates all instances of the Requesting_MAP_SSM or Performing_MAP_SSM which are active for this dialogue.
Sheet 14: A MAP-DELIMITER request triggers a TC-CONTINUE request to accept the dialogue. The dialogue has then reached the established state.
15.3	Dialogue continuation
Once established the dialogue is said to be in a continuation phase. The behaviour of the MAP dialogue state machine in this phase is defined in sheets 15 – 17 of the process MAP_DSM (figure 15.6/3).
Both MAP users can request the transfer of MAP APDUs until one of them requests the termination of the dialogue.
Normal closure of an established dialogue is shown on sheet 16; abnormal termination is shown on sheet 17.
15.4	Load control
If an entity which should respond to a MAP dialogue opening request is overloaded, it uses the AC of the request to determine whether to discard the request. 
The priority level allocated to each application-context is described in clause 5, tables 5.1/1, 5.1/2, and 5.1/3.
15.5	Procedures for MAP specific services
This clause describes the MAP procedures for MAP specific services. These procedures are driven by the following types of event:
-	a MAP specific request or a MAP specific response primitive;
-	a component handling primitive from TC.
A Service State Machine is activated when of one of the following signals is received:
-	a MAP request primitive, which activates a requesting SSM;
-	a TC-INVOKE indication primitive without a linked identifier, which activates a performing SSM.
For component handling primitives there are two types of event:
-	events which activate a Service State Machine or which can be related to an existing one;
-	events which cannot be related to a Service State Machine.
15.5.1	Service invocation 
The behaviour of the requesting SSM which handles a service is defined by the SDL for the process Requesting_MAP_SSM. The requesting SSM receives a MAP service request from the MAP-Service User via the MAP dialogue state machine and sends a TC-INVOKE request to TCAP. When a confirm is received from TCAP via the MAP dialogue state machine, the requesting SSM forwards a MAP service confirm to the MAP-Service User.
The response to a MAP service invocation may come in the form of a linked request. If the linked request corresponds to a class 4 operation, this is handled by the requesting SSM. If the linked request corresponds to a class 1, 2 or 3 operation, the MAP dialogue state machine sends a notification to the requesting SSM and creates an instance of a performing SSM to handle the linked request. The test "Linked_Operation_Allowed" on sheet 3 of the process Requesting_MAP_SSM takes the (TRUE) exit if the definition of the parent operation includes the received linked operation as a permitted linked operation; otherwise the test takes the (FALSE) exit.
The mapping of MAP specific services on to remote operations is given in table 16.2/1.
15.5.2	Void
15.5.3	Service invocation receipt 
The behaviour of the performing SSM which handles a service is defined by the SDL for the process Performing_MAP_SSM. The performing SSM receives a TC-INVOKE component from TCAP via the MAP dialogue state machine and sends a MAP service indication to the MAP-Service User. When a MAP service response is received from the MAP-Service User via the MAP dialogue state machine, the performing SSM forwards a TC-RESULT or TC-U-ERROR component to TCAP.
15.5.4	Void
15.5.5	Handling of components received from TC
The procedure Process_Components shows the handling of components received in a TC-BEGIN, TC-CONTINUE or TC-END message.
Sheet 2: If a linked invoke component corresponds to a class 4 operation, the MAP dialogue state machine sends it to the requesting SSM instance identified by the linked invoke ID. If a linked invoke component corresponds to any other class of operation, the MAP dialogue state machine sends a notification to the requesting SSM instance identified by the linked invoke ID, creates an instance of a performing SSM and sends the invoke component to it.
15.6	SDL descriptions
The following SDL specification describes a system which includes three blocks: MAP-user, MAP-provider and TC.
Such a system resides in each network component supporting MAP and communicates with its peers via the lower layers of the signalling network which are part of the environment.
Only the MAP-provider is fully described in this clause. The various types of processes which form the MAP-User block and the TC block are described respectively in clauses 18 to 25 of the present document and in CCITT Recommendation Q.774.
The MAP-Provider block communicates with the MAP_USER via two channels U1 and U2. Via U1 the MAP-provider receives the MAP request and response primitives. Via U2 it sends the MAP indication and confirm primitives.
The MAP-Provider block communicates with TC via two channels P1 and P2. Via P1 the MAP-Provider sends all the TC request primitives. Via P2 it receives all the TC indication primitives.
The MAP-Provider block is composed of the four following types of process:
a)	MAP_DSM: This type of process handles a dialogue for transport of MAP messages. There exists one process instance per MAP dialogue.
b)	Load_Ctrl: This type of process is in charge of load control. There is only one instance of this process in each system.
c)	Requesting_MAP_SSM: This type of process handles a MAP service requested during a dialogue. An instance of this process is created by the instance of the MAP_DSM process for each requested MAP service. 
d)	Performing_MAP_SSM: This type of process handles a MAP service performed during a dialogue. An instance of this process is created by the instance of the MAP_DSM process for each MAP service to be performed. 
A process MAP_DSM exchanges external signals with other blocks as well as internal signals with the other processes of the MAP-Provider block. The external signals are either MAP service primitives or TC service primitives.
The signal routes used by the various processes are organised as follows:
a)	A process MAP_DSM receives and sends events from/to the MAP_user via signal route User1/User2. These routes use channels U1 and U2 respectively.
b)	A process MAP_DSM receives and sends events from/to the TCAP via signal route TC1/TC2. These routes use channels P1 and P2 respectively.
c)	A process MAP_DSM receives and sends events from/to the LOAD_CTRL process via signal route Load1/Load2. These routes are internal.
d)	A process MAP_DSM sends events to the Performing_MAP_SSM processes via signal route Intern1. This route is internal.
e)	A process MAP_DSM sends events to the Requesting_MAP_SSM processes via signal route Intern2. This route is internal.
f)	A process Performing_MAP_SSM sends events to the MAP_USER via signal route User3. This route uses channel U2.
g)	A process Performing_MAP_SSM sends events to the TCAP via signal route TC3. This route uses channel P1.
h)	A process Requesting_MAP_SSM sends events to the MAP_USER via signal route User4. This route uses channel U2.
i)	A process Requesting_MAP_SSM sends events to the TCAP via signal route TC4. This route uses channel P1.

16	Mapping on to TC services
16.1	Dialogue control
Dialogue control services are mapped to TC dialogue handling services. The TC-UNI service is not used by the MAP PM.
16.1.1	Directly mapped parameters
The following parameters of the MAP-OPEN request and indication primitives are directly mapped on to the corresponding parameters of the TC-BEGIN primitives:
-	destination address;
-	originating address.
16.1.2	Use of other parameters of dialogue handling primitives
16.1.2.1	Dialogue Id
The value of this parameter is associated with the MAP PM invocation in an implementation dependent manner.
16.1.2.2	Application-context-name
The application-context-name parameter of a MAP primitive is mapped to the application-context-name parameter of TC dialogue handling primitives according to the rules described in clause 15.1.
16.1.2.3	User information
The user information parameter of TC dialogue primitives is used to carry the MAP dialogue APDUs.
16.1.2.4	Component present
This parameter is used by the MAP PM as described in CCITT Recommendation Q.771. It is not visible to the MAP user.
16.1.2.5	Termination
The value of this parameter of the TC-END request primitive is set by the MAP PM on the basis of the release method parameter of the MAP-CLOSE request primitive, except when the dialogue state machine is in the state DIALOGUE INITIATED, in which case the Termination parameter shall always indicate "pre-arranged end".
16.1.2.6	P-Abort-Cause
Values of the P-abort-cause parameter are mapped to the values of the provider-reason parameter of the MAP‑P‑ABORT indication primitive according to table 16.1/1, except in the dialogue initiated phase for the "incorrectTransactionPortion" and "noCommonDialoguePortion" values which are mapped to the "potential incompatibility problem" value of the refuse-reason parameter of the MAP-OPEN cnf primitive. The source parameter in the MAP-P-ABORT ind takes the value "TC problem".
16.1.2.7	Quality of service
The quality of service of TC request primitives is set by the MAP as shown below.
-	Return option: "Return message on error" or "Discard message on error" as required by the network operator;
-	Sequence control: "Sequence guaranteed" or "Sequence result not guaranteed" as required by the network operator;
-	"Sequence guaranteed" shall be used when a segmented result is to be transferred (e.g. subscriber data in response to SendParameters). It may also be appropriate to use Sequence guaranteed when a series of InsertSubscriberData, ProcessAccessSignalling or ForwardAccessSignalling operations is used.
It is essential that the TC message which indicates acceptance of a dialogue opening request is received by the dialogue initiator before any subsequent message in that dialogue; otherwise the dialogue opening will fail. The dialogue responder shall ensure that this requirement is met by:
-	Sending the dialogue acceptance message in a TC‑END, if the dialogue structure requires it; or
-	Using "Sequence guaranteed", if the dialogue acceptance message is sent in a TC‑CONTINUE; or
-	Waiting until the dialogue acceptance message has been acknowledged by the dialogue initiator before sending a subsequent message, if the dialogue acceptance message is sent in a TC‑CONTINUE.

16.2	Service specific procedures
Specific services are mapped to TC component handling services.
16.2.1	Directly mapped parameters
The Invoke Id parameter of the MAP request and indication primitive is directly mapped on to the Invoke Id parameter of the component handling primitives.
16.2.2	Use of other parameters of component handling primitives
16.2.2.1	Dialogue Id
The value of this parameter is associated with the MAP PM invocation in an implementation dependent manner.
16.2.2.2	Class
The value of this parameter is set by the MAP PM according to the type of the operation to be invoked.
16.2.2.3	Linked Id
When a service response is mapped to a class 4 operation, the value of this parameter is set by the MAP PM and corresponds to the value assigned by the user to the initial service request (i.e. the value of the invoke ID parameter of the request primitive). Otherwise if such a parameter is included in MAP request/indication primitives it is directly mapped to the linked ID parameter of the associated TC‑INVOKE request/indication primitives.
16.2.2.4	Operation
When mapping a request primitive on to a Remote Operations PDU (invoke), the MAP PM shall set the operation code according to the mapping described in table 16.2/1.
When mapping a response primitive on to a Remote Operations service, the MAP PM shall set the operation code of the TC-RESULT-L/NL primitive (if required) to the same value as the one received at invocation time.

16.2.2.5	Error
The error parameter in a TC-U-ERROR indication primitive is mapped to the user error parameter in the MAP confirm primitive of the service associated with the operation to which the error is attached.
The user error parameter in MAP response primitives is mapped to the error parameter of the TC‑U‑ERROR request primitive, except for "initiating-release" and "resource-limitation" which are mapped to the problem code parameter of the TC-U-REJECT request primitive.
16.2.2.6	Parameters
The parameters of MAP specific request and indication primitives are mapped to the argument parameter of TC-INVOKE primitives.
The parameters of MAP specific response and confirm primitives are mapped to the result parameter of TC-RESULT-L primitives, the parameter of TC-U-ERROR primitives or the argument of TC-INVOKE primitives when mapping on linked class 4 operations is used.
16.2.2.7	Time out
The value of this parameter is set by the MAP PM according to the type of operation invoked.

17	Abstract syntax of the MAP protocol
17.1	General
This clause specifies the Abstract Syntaxes for the Mobile Application Part as well as the associated set of Operations and Errors, using the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), defined in ITU-T Recommendations X.680  and X.681 with additions as defined in clause 17.1.4 on Compatibility Considerations and the OPERATION and ERROR external information object classes, defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.880.
The Abstract Syntax is defined for all interfaces specified in clause 4.4 except for the A- and B-interfaces.
The Mobile Application Part protocol is defined by two Abstract Syntaxes:
-	one Abstract Syntax which encompass all Operations and Errors identified by the various MAP subsystem numbers.
This Abstract Syntax represents the set of values each of which is a value of the ASN.1 type TCAPMessages. TCMessage as defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.773 with the component relationconstraint clauses resolved by the operation and error codes included in the ASN.1 modules MAP-*Operations and MAP-Errors. However, only the subset of this abstract syntax which is required by the procedures defined for an entity needs to be supported.
-	one Abstract Syntax identified by the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value MAP-DialogueInformation.map-DialogueAS.
This Abstract Syntax represents the set of values each of which is a value of the ASN.1 type MAP-DialogueInformation.MAP-DialoguePDU. Such a value of the ASN.1 single-ASN.1-type element is contained within the user-information element of the TCAPMessages.DialoguePortion ASN.1 type. This Abstract Syntax name is to be used as a direct reference.
17.1.1	Encoding rules
The encoding rules which are applicable to the defined Abstract Syntaxes are the Basic Encoding Rules for Abstract Syntax Notation One, defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.690 with the same exceptions as in ITU-T Recommendation Q.773, clause 4 Message Representation.
When the definite form is used for length encoding, a data value of length less than 128 octets must have the length encoded in the short form.
When the long form is employed to code a length, the minimum number of octets shall be used to code the length field.
OCTET STRING values and BIT STRING values must be encoded in a primitive form.
There is no restriction to the use of empty constructors (e.g. an empty SEQUENCE type). That is, the encoding of the content of any data value shall consist of zero, one or more octets.
17.1.2	Use of TC
The mapping of OPERATION and ERROR to TC components is defined in ETS 300 287 (version 2) which is based on ITU-T Recommendation Q.773.
NOTE 1:	The class of an operation is not stated explicitly but is specified as well in the ASN.1 operation definition.
	Class 1: RESULT and ERROR appear in ASN.1 operation definition.
	Class 2: only ERROR appears in ASN.1 operation definition.
	Class 3: only RESULT appears in ASN.1 operation definition.
	Class 4: both RESULT and ERROR do not appear in ASN.1 operation definition.
The field "ARGUMENT", "PARAMETER" or "RESULT" (for information objects of class OPERATION and ERROR) is always optional from a syntactic point of view. However, except when specifically mentioned with the ASN.1 comment "-- optional" , the "parameter" part of a component has to be considered as mandatory from a semantic point of view.
When an optional element is missing in an invoke component or in an inner data structure while it is required by the context, an error component is returned if specified in the information object associated with the operation ; the associated type of error is "DataMissing". This holds also when the entire parameter of an invoke component is missing while it is required by the context.
NOTE 2:	When a mandatory element is missing in the parameter or inner data structure of any component, a reject component is returned (if the dialogue still exists). The problem code to be used is "Mistyped parameter".
The Timer Values used in the operation definitions are indicated as ASN.1 comments. The Timer Value Ranges are:
s	= from 3 seconds to 10 seconds;
m	= from 15 seconds to 30 seconds;
ml	= from 1 minute to 10 minutes;
l	= from 28 hours to 38 hours.
17.1.2.1	Use of Global Operation and Error codes defined outside MAP
An entity supporting an application context greater than 2 shall be capable of receiving an operation or error code, within an application context defined in GSM 29.002, encoded as either an Object Identifier (as defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.690 ) or an integer value (as defined in clause 17.5). Related restrictions regarding the use of Object Identifiers are as follows:
-	The length of the Object Identifier shall not exceed 16 octets and the number of components of the Object Identifier shall not exceed 16.
-	Object Identifiers shall be used only for operations or errors defined outside of GSM 29.002.
-	Global error codes may be sent only in response to a global operation. If a standard operation is received then a global error code shall not be sent in response.
Handling of an unknown operation codes by the receiving entity is defined in clause 15.1.1.
17.1.3	Use of information elements defined outside MAP
An information element or a set of information elements (messages) transparently carried in the Mobile Application Part but defined in other recommendations/technical specifications are handled in one of the following ways:
i)	The contents of each information element (without the octets encoding the identifier and the length in the recommendation/technical specification where it is defined unless explicitly stated otherwise) is carried as the value of an ASN.1 type derived from the OCTET STRING data type. Additionally, the internal structure may be explained by means of comments. In case of misalignment the referred to recommendation/technical specification takes precedence.
ii)	The complete information element (including the octets encoding the identifier and the length in the recommendation/technical specification where it is defined) or set of information elements and the identity of the associated protocol are carried as the value of the ExternalSignalInfo data type defined in the present document. Where more than one information element is carried, the information elements are sent contiguously with no filler octets between them.
17.1.4	Compatibility considerations
The following ASN.1 modules conform to ITU-T Recommendation X.680 and X.681 . An extension marker ("...") is used wherever future protocol extensions are foreseen.
The "..." construct applies only to SEQUENCE and ENUMERATED data types. An entity supporting a version greater than 1 shall not reject an unsupported extension following "..." of that SEQUENCE or ENUMERATED data type. The Encoding Rules from clause 17.1.1 apply to every element of the whole Transfer Syntax especially to the ASN.1 type EXTERNAL.
The extension container "privateExtensionList" is defined in this specification in order to carry extensions which are defined outside this specification. Private extensions can be defined by, for example, network operators, manufacturers, and regional standardisation bodies.
Private extensions shall:
1)	if included in operations of an AC of V2, follow the extension marker and be tagged using PRIVATE tags up to and including 29.
NOTE: This type of extension is in most cases used only within a PLMN.
2)	if included in operations of an AC of V3 or higher: be included only in the Private Extension Container that is defined in the specification.
NOTE: This type of extension can be used between PLMNs.
Private extensions shall not be included in v2 supplementary service operations.
Private extensions shall not be included within user error for RegisterCCEntry and EraseCCEntry operations.
PCS extensions shall be included in the PCS Extension Container that is defined in this specification.
In order to improve extensibility, a few error parameters have been defined as a CHOICE between the version 2 description and a SEQUENCE including the version 2 description and an extension container. Operations used in a v2-application-context must consider only the first alternative while operations used in a vn-application-context (n>2) must consider only the second alternative.
17.1.5	Structure of the Abstract Syntax of MAP
For each MAP parameter which has to be transferred by a MAP Protocol Data Unit (MAP message), there is a PDU field (an ASN.1 type) which has the same name as the corresponding parameter, except for the differences required by the ASN.1 notation (blanks between words are removed or replaced by hyphen, the first letter of the first word is capital and the first letter of each of the following words ise capitalised, e.g. "no reply condition time" is mapped to "NoReplyConditionTime"). Additionally some words may be abbreviated as follows:
bs	basic service
ch	call handling
cug	closed user group
ho	handover
ic	incoming call
id	identity
info	information
mm	mobility management
lcs	location services
ms	mobile service
oc	outgoing call
om	operation & maintenance
pw	Password
sm	short message service
ss	supplementary service 
The MAP protocol is composed of several ASN.1 modules dealing with either operations, errors, data types, and, if applicable, split into those dealing with mobile services, call handling services, supplementary services and short message services. For operations and errors the code values are given as parameters,  in order to allow use of the defined information objects also by other protocols (e.g. 3GPP TS 24.080 [38]). The ASN.1 source lines are preceded by line-numbers at the left margin in order to enable the usage of the cross-reference in annex A.
The module containing the definition of the operation packages for MAP is:
1.	MAP-OperationPackages.
The module containing the definition of the application contexts for MAP is:
2.	MAP-ApplicationContexts.
The module containing the data types for the Abstract Syntax to be used for TCAPMessages.DialoguePortion for MAP is:

NOTE (*):	The syntax of the operations is not the same as in previous versions unless explicitly stated
In the word-text of ASN.1 Modules hidden text is used for marking the begin (.$modulename), interrupt (.#), continuation (.$) and end (.#END) of ASN.1 Source. This allows to automatically extract the ASN.1 Sources. These markers should not be deleted! In addition, hidden text is also used to overcome some compiler restrictions
In addition no line break should occur when printing a paragraph in ASN.1 source, otherwise the line-numbering of word is inconsistent with the line-numbering in Annex A.
For Completeness the module MAP-Frame is included as hidden text.

17.2	Operation packages
17.2.1	General aspects
This clause describes the operation-packages which are used to build the application-contexts defined in clause 17.3.
Each operation-package is a specification of the roles of a pair of communicating objects (i.e. a pair of MAP-Providers), in terms of operations which they can invoke of each other.
The grouping of operations into one or several packages does not necessarily imply any grouping in terms of Application Service Elements.
The following ASN.1 information object class is used to describe operation-packages in this clause:
OPERATION-PACKAGE ::= CLASS {
	&Both     OPERATION     	OPTIONAL,
	&Consumer OPERATION     	OPTIONAL,
	&Supplier OPERATION     	OPTIONAL,
	&id       OBJECT IDENTIFIER	UNIQUE OPTIONAL } 
WITH SYNTAX {
	[ OPERATIONS       &Both ]
	[ CONSUMER INVOKES &Supplier ]
	[ SUPPLIER INVOKES &Consumer ]
	[ ID               &id ] }

Since the application-context definitions provided in clause 17.3 use only an informal description technique, only the type notation is used in the following clauses to define operation-packages.
The following definitions are used throughout this clause (n>=2):
-	v1-only operation: An operation which shall be used only in v1 application-contexts;
-	vn-only operation: An operation which shall be used only in vn application-contexts;
-	v(n-1)-operation: An operation whose specification has not been modified since the MAP v(n-1) specifications or if the modifications are considered as not affecting v(n-1) implementations;
-	v(n-1)-equivalent operation: The version of an operation which excludes all the information elements and errors which have been added since the MAP v(n-1) specification;
-	vn-only package: An operation package which contains only vn-only operations;
-	v(n-1)-package: An operation package which contains only v(n-1)- operations.
The names of vn-packages are suffixed by "-vn" where n>=2.
For each operation package which is not vn-only (n>=2) and which does not include only v(n-1)-operations, there is a v(n-1)-equivalent package. Except when a definition is explicitly provided in the following clauses, the v(n‑1)‑equivalent package includes the v(n-1)-equivalent operations of the operations which belong to this package.

17.3	Application contexts
17.3.1	General aspects
An application-context is assigned for each dialogue established by a MAP-user. In the present document each application-context is assigned a name which is supplied in the MAP-OPEN Req primitive by the MAP-User and transmitted to the peer under certain circumstances.
The following ASN.1 information object class is used to describe the main aspects of application-contexts in the following clauses:
APPLICATION-CONTEXT ::= CLASS {
	&Symmetric           OPERATION-PACKAGE OPTIONAL,
	&InitiatorConsumerOf OPERATION-PACKAGE OPTIONAL,
	&ResponderConsumerOf OPERATION-PACKAGE OPTIONAL,
	&code                OBJECT IDENTIFIER } 
WITH SYNTAX {
	[ OPERATIONS OF         &Symmetric ]
	[ INITIATOR CONSUMER OF &InitiatorConsumerOf
	RESPONDER CONSUMER OF &ResponderConsumerOf ]
	ID &code }


The following definitions are used throughout this clause:
-	v1-application-context: An application-context which contains only v1-packages and uses only TC v1 facilities;
-	v1 context set: the set of v1-application-contexts defined in the present document.
-	vn-application-context (n>=2): An application-context which contains only vn-packages;
The names of v1-application-contexts are suffixed by "-v1" while other names are suffixed by "-vn" where n>=2.
Application-contexts which do not belong to the v1 context set use v2 TC facilities.
The last component of each application-context-name (i.e. the last component of the object identifier value) assigned to an application-context which belongs to the v1 context set indicates explicitly "version1".
For each application-context which does not belong to the "v1 context set" there is a v1-equivalent application context. This is a v1-application-context which includes the v1-equivalents of the packages included in the original context.
Each application-context uses the abstract-syntax associated with the operation-packages it includes and uses the transfer-syntax derived from it by applying the encoding rules defined in clause 17.1.1.
ACs which do not belong to the v1 context set require the support of the abstract-syntax identified by the object identifier value: MAP-DialogueInformation.map-Dialogue-AS defined in clause 17.4.

18	General on MAP user procedures
18.1	Introduction
Clauses 18 to 25 describe the use of MAP services for GSM signalling procedures. GSM signalling procedures may involve one or several interfaces running one or several application protocols. The present document addresses only the signalling procedures which require at least the use of one MAP service.
When a signalling procedure takes place in the network, an application process invocation is created in each system component involved. Part of the application process invocation acts as a MAP user and handles one or several MAP dialogues. For each dialogue it employs an instance of the MAP service provider. It may also use other communication services to exchange information on other interfaces, but detailed description of these aspects is outside the scope of the present document.
18.2	Common aspects of user procedure descriptions
18.2.1	General conventions
For each signalling procedure the present document provides a brief textual overview accompanied by a flow diagram which represent the functional interactions between system components. Functional interactions are labelled using the MAP service name when the interaction results from a service request or by this service name followed by the symbol "ack" when this interaction results from a service response.
For each of the system components involved, the present document also provides a detailed textual description of the application process behaviour as well as an SDL diagram. SDL diagrams describe the sequence of events, as seen by the MAP-User, which occurs at MAP service provider boundaries as well as external events which occur at other interfaces and which impact on the previous sequence.
External events do not necessarily correspond to the messages of other protocols used in the system component. The MAP-user procedures are described as if a set of interworking functions (IWF) between the MAP-user and the other protocol entities was implemented (see figure 18.2/1). Such interworking functions are assumed to perform either an identity mapping or some processing or translation as required to eliminate information irrelevant to the MAP-user.
The mapping of service primitives on to protocol elements is described in clauses 14 to 17.
GSM signalling procedures are built from one or more sub-procedures (e.g. authentication, ciphering, ...). Sub‑procedures from which signalling procedures are built are represented using SDL MACRO descriptions.
In case of any discrepancy between the textual descriptions and the SDL descriptions, the latter take precedence.
18.2.2	Naming conventions
Events related to MAP are represented by MAP service primitives. The signal names used in the SDL diagrams are derived from the service primitive names defined in clauses 7 to 12, with some lexical transformations for readability and parsability purposes (blanks between words are replaced by underscores, the first letter of each word is capitalised).
Events received and sent on other interfaces are named by appending the message or signal name to a symbol representing the interface type, with some lexical transformations for readability and parsability purposes (blanks between words are replaced by underscores, the first letter of each word is capitalised).
The following symbols are used to represent the interface types:
"I":	For interfaces to the fixed network. "I" stands for ISUP interface.
"A":	For interfaces between the MSC and the BSS (i.e. A-interfaces);
"Gb":	For interfaces between the SGSN and the BSS (i.e. Gb-interfaces);
"OM":	For network management interfaces (communication with OMC, MML interface, ...);
"SC":	For interfaces to a Service Centre;
"HO_CA":	For internal interfaces to the Handover Control Application.
"US":	For a local USSD application.
These naming conventions can be summarised by the following BNF description:
<Event_Name>	::= <MAP_Primitive> | <External_Event>
<MAP_Primitive>	::= <MAP_Open> | <MAP_Close> | <MAP_U_Abort> | <MAP_P_Abort> |

Figure 18.2/1: Interfaces applicable to the MAP-User
18.2.3	Convention on primitives parameters
18.2.3.1	Open service
When the originating and destination reference parameters shall be included in the MAP-OPEN request primitive, their value are indicated as a comment to the signal which represents this primitive.
18.2.3.2	Close service
When a pre-arranged released is requested, a comment is attached to the signal which represents the MAP-CLOSE request primitive. In the absence of comment, a normal release is assumed.
18.2.4	Version handling at dialogue establishment
Unless explicitly indicated in subsequent clauses, the following principles regarding version handling procedures at dialogue establishment are applied by the MAP-user.
18.2.4.1	Behaviour at the initiating side
When a MAP user signalling procedure has to be executed, the MAP-user issues a MAP-OPEN request primitive with an appropriate application-context-name. If several names are supported (i.e. several versions) a suitable one is selected using the procedures described in clause 5.
 
If version n is selected (where 1 < n <= highest existing version) and a MAP-OPEN Confirm primitive is received in response to the MAP-OPEN request with a result parameter set to "refused" and a diagnostic parameter indicating "application context not supported" or "potential version incompatibility problem", the MAP-User issues a new MAP-OPEN request primitive with the equivalent version y context (where 1 <= y < n). This is informally represented in the SDL diagrams by task symbols indicating 'Perform Vr procedure".
18.2.4.2	Behaviour at the responding side
On receipt of a MAP-OPEN indication primitive, the MAP-User analyses the application-context-name and executes the procedure associated with the requested version context. For example,if it refers to a version one context, the associated V1 procedure is executed; if it refers to a version two context, the associated V2 procedure is executed;etc.
18.2.5	Abort Handling
Unless explicitly indicated in subsequent clauses, the following principles are applied by the MAP-user regarding abort handling procedures:
On receipt of a MAP-P-ABORT indication or MAP-U-ABORT Indication primitive from any MAP-provider invocation, the MAP-User issues a MAP-U-ABORT Request primitive to each MAP-provider invocation associated with the same user procedure.
If applicable a decision is made to decide if the affected user procedure has to be retried or not.
18.2.6	SDL conventions
The MAP SDLs make use of a number of SDL concepts and conventions, where not all of them may be widely known. Therefore, this clause outlines the use of a few concepts and conventions to improve understanding of the MAP SDLs.
The MAP User SDLs make use of SDL Processes, Procedures and Macros. Processes are independent from each other even if one process starts another one: The actions of both of them have no ordering in time. SDL Procedures and Macros are just used to ease writing of the specification: They contain parts of a behaviour used in several places, and the corresponding Procedure/Macro definition has to be expanded at the position of the Procedure/Macro call.
All Processes are started at system initialisation and live forever, unless process creation/termination is indicated explicitly (i.e. a process is created by some other process).
The direction of Input/Output Signals in the SDL graphs is used to indicate the entity to which/from which communication is directed. If a process A communicates in parallel with processes B and C, all Inputs/Outputs to/from B are directed to one side, whereas communication with C is directed to the other side. However, there has been no formal convention used that communication to a certain entity (e.g. a HLR) will always be directed to a certain side (e.g. right).
In each state all those Input Signals are listed, which result in an action and/or state change. If an Input Signal is not listed in a state, receipt of this input should lead to an implicit consumption without any action or state change (according to the SDL rules). This implicit consumption is mainly used for receipt of the MAP DELIMITER indication and for receipt of a MAP CLOSE indication, except for a premature MAP CLOSE.
18.3	Interaction between MAP Provider and MAP Users
Each MAP User is defined by at least one SDL process. On the dialogue initiating side, the MAP User will create a new instance of a MAP Provider implicit by issuing a MAP-OPEN request. This instance corresponds to a TC Dialogue and lives as long as the dialogue exists (see also clause 14.3). There is a fixed relation between MAP User and this Provider instance, i.e. all MAP service primitives from the MAP User for this dialogue are sent to this instance and all TC components received by this MAP Provider are mapped onto service primitives sent to this MAP User.
On the receiving side a MAP Provider instance is created implicit by receipt of a TC BEGIN indication. The corresponding MAP User is determined by the Application Context name included in this primitive, i.e. each Application Context is associated with one and only one MAP User. An instance of this User will be created implicitly by receiving a MAP-OPEN indication. Note that in some cases there exist several SDL Processes for one MAP User (Application Context), e.g. the processes Register_SS_HLR, Erase_SS_HLR, Activate_SS_HLR, Deactivate_SS_HLR, Interrogate_SS_HLR, and Register_Password for the AC Network_Functional_SS_Handling. In these cases, a coordinator process is introduced acting as a MAP User, which in turn starts a sub-process depending on the first MAP service primitive received.
19	Mobility procedures
19.1	Location management Procedures
The signalling procedures in this clause support:
-	Interworking between the VLR and the HLR and between the VLR and the previous VLR (PVLR) when a non-GPRS subscriber performs a location update to a new VLR service area;
-	Interworking between the SGSN, the HLR and the VLR when a subscriber with both GPRS and non-GPRS subscriptions performs a routeing area update in an SGSN and the Gs interface is implemented;
-	Interworking between the SGSN and the VLR when a GPRS subscriber performs a routeing area update to a new SGSN service area;
-	Interworking between the HLR and the VLR and between the HLR and the SGSN to delete a subscriber record from the VLR or the SGSN;
-	Interworking between the VLR and the HLR and between the SGSN and the HLR to report to the HLR that a subscriber record has been purged from the VLR or the SGSN.
The MAP co-ordinating process in the HLR to handle a dialogue opened with the network location updating context is shown in figure 19.1/1. The MAP process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind	see clause 25.1.1.

19.1.2	Location Cancellation
19.1.2.1	General
Location cancellation is used to delete a subscriber record from the serving node (VLR or SGSN). The procedure is invoked:
-	because the subscriber has registered with a new serving node, or
-	because the HPLMN operator has decided to delete the subscriber record from the serving node, e.g. because the subscription has been withdrawn, or because roaming restrictions have been imposed. Location cancellation can be used to force location updating including updating of subscriber data in the serving node at the next subscriber access.
The message flow for location cancellation for a non-GPRS subscriber is shown in figure 19.1.2/1.
The message flow for location cancellation for a GPRS subscriber is shown in figure 19.1.2/2.

19.1.2A.1	General
Location cancellation for VCSG is used to delete a subscriber record from the serving node (VLR or SGSN). The procedure is invoked:
-	because there is a removal of the CSG subscription data in the CSS and of the MS registration
-	because the CSS has decided to cancel the registration of the MS which does not have CSG subscription data in the CSS.
NOTE:	How the CSS determines when to cancel the registration of the MS is implementation dependent.

19.1.4.1	General
O&M procedures in the VLR or SGSN can trigger MS purging either because of administrative action or because the MS has been inactive for an extended period. The O&M process in the VLR or in the SGSN should ensure that during the MS purging procedure any other attempt to access the MS record is blocked, to maintain consistency of data.

19.2	Handover procedures
19.2.1	General
In this clause, the term "Inter-MSC handover" is used to denote handover or relocation between different MSCs.
The interfaces involved for Inter-MSC handover are shown in figure 19.2/1. There are two Inter-MSC handover procedures:
1)	Basic Inter-MSC handover:
	The call is handed over from the controlling MSC(MSC—A) to another MSC(MSC—B) (figure 19.2/1a).
	Figure 19.2/2 shows the message flow for a successful handover from MSC‑A to MSC—B, including a request for handover number allocation from MSC‑B to VLR‑B.
2)	Subsequent Inter-MSC handover:
	After the call has been handed over from MSC‑A to MSC‑B, a further handover either to MSC‑A (figure 19.2/1a) or to a third MSC (MSC‑B') (figure 19.2/1b) may be  necessary in order to continue the call.
	Figure 19.2/3 shows the message flow for a successful subsequent handover to MSC‑B'. For a successful subsequent handover to MSC‑A, the messages to and from MSC‑B' and VLR‑B' are omitted..

a) Basic handover procedure MSC‑A to MSC‑B 
and subsequent handover procedure MSC‑B to MSC‑A.

b) Subsequent handover procedure MSC‑B to MSC‑B'.

Figure 19.2/3: Example of a successful subsequent handover to a third MSC
The MAP signalling procedures for inter-MSC handover support the allocation of a handover number or one or more relocation numbers and the transfer of encapsulated BSSAP or RANAP messages.
The minimum application context version for the MAP handover application context shall be:
-	version 3 for inter-MSC UTRAN to UTRAN handover;
-	version 3 for inter-MSC intersystem handover from GSM BSS to UTRAN;
-	version 2 for inter-MSC intersystem handover from UTRAN to GSM BSS.
NOTE:	If the MAP handover application context version 2 is used, subsequent handover to UTRAN is not possible.
The minimum application context version for the MAP handover application context should be version 2 for inter-MSC handover from GSM BSS to GSM BSS.
NOTE:	If the MAP handover application context version 2 or lower is used, subsequent handover to UTRAN is not possible.
The BSSAP or RANAP messages encapsulated in MAP messages are processed by the Handover Control Application in each MSC. The information in the encapsulated BSSAP or RANAP messages is passed from the Handover Control Application to the MAP process at the sending end; the notation used in the SDL diagrams for the MAP processes is "HO_CA_MESSAGE_ind(Message transfer)". The information in the encapsulated BSSAP or RANAP messages is passed from the MAP process to the Handover Control Application at the sending end; the notation used in the SDL diagrams for the MAP processes is "HO_CA_MESSAGE_req(Message transfer)".
For details of the interworking between the A-interface and MAP procedures or the Iu-interface and MAP procedures, see 3GPP TS 23.009 [21] and 3GPP TS 29.010 [58].
19.2.2	Procedure in MSC‑A
This clause describes the inter-MSC handover procedure in MSC‑A; it covers basic inter-MSC handover to another MSC (MSC‑B) and subsequent inter-MSC handover to a third MSC (MSC‑B') or back to the controlling MSC (MSC‑A).
The MAP process in MSC‑A to handle inter-MSC handover is shown in figure 19.2/4. The MAP process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Cnf		see clause 25.1.2;
Check_Indication		see clause 25.2.1.
Check_Confirmation		see clause 25.2.2.
Communication between the MAP handover process and the Handover Control application is represented by the HO_CA_MESSAGE service. For a detailed description of the interworking between the Handover Control applications in different MSCs for the inter-MSC handover procedure, see 3GPP TS 23.009 [21].
19.2.2.1	Basic handover
The handling in MSC‑A for basic inter-MSC handover is shown in sheets 1 to 6 of figure 19.2/4.
Sheet 1: The MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER request may contain:
-	an indication that handover number allocation is not required;
-	the target Cell ID, for compatibility for handover to GSM;
-	the target RNC ID, for SRNS relocation or inter-system handover from GSM to UMTS;
-	the IMSI;
-	UMTS encryption information and UMTS integrity protection information, which are necessary for inter-system handover from GSM to UMTS;
-	GSM radio resource information (channel type); 
-	the LCLS Global Call Reference;
 -	the LCLS-Negotiation;
-	the LCLS-Configuration-Preference.
The conditions for the presence of these parameters and the processing in MSC‑B (3G_MSC‑B) are described in detail in 3GPP TS 29.010 [58], 3GPP TS 23.009 [21] and 3GPP TS 29.205 [146].
Sheet 2: The MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER confirmation contains one of:
-	no handover number, if the MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER request included an indication that handover number allocation is not required;
-	a handover number;
-	one or more relocation numbers.
Sheet 2: The MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER confirmation contains BSSAP or RANAP signalling information, which is passed to the Handover Control application in MSC‑A.
Sheet 2: If the MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER confirmation contains an indication that MSC‑B does not support multiple bearers, the Handover Control application in MSC‑A may request handover of one bearer to the same cell in MSC‑B.
Sheet 5: If the original MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER request included a parameter indicating that handover number allocation is not required, the Handover Control application in MSC‑A may request a handover number (or one or more relocation numbers); this triggers a further MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER request towards MSC‑B.
19.2.2.2	Handling of access signalling
The Handover Control application in MSC‑A may forward access signalling to any of the MS, RNS‑B or BSS‑B using the MAP_FORWARD_ACCESS_SIGNALLING service; any of the MS, RNS‑B or BSS‑B may forward access signalling to the Handover Control application in MSC‑A using the MAP_PROCESS_ACCESS_SIGNALLING service. These are non-confirmed services.
19.2.2.3	Subsequent handover
The handling in MSC‑A for subsequent inter-MSC handover is shown in sheets 7 & 8 of figure 19.2/4. If the Handover Control Application determines that the call is to be handed over to a third MSC (MSC‑B') it triggers another instance of the MAP process to handle the basic handover to MSC‑B', and reports the result of the subsequent handover to the instance of the MAP process which handles the dialogue with MSC‑B.
Sheet 8: While the MAP process in MSC‑A is waiting for the completion of subsequent handover, it relays access signalling between the Handover Control application and the MS, RNS‑B or BSS‑B as described in clause 19.2.2.2.
19.2.3	Procedure in MSC‑B
This clause describes the handover or relocation procedure in MSC‑B; it covers basic handover or relocation from the controlling MSC (MSC‑A) and subsequent handover or relocation.
The MAP process in MSC‑B to handle handover or relocation is shown in figure 19.2/5. The MAP process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind		see clause 25.1.1;
Receive_Open_Cnf		see clause 25.1.2;
Check_Indication		see clause 25.2.1.
Check_Confirmation		see clause 25.2.2.
Communication between the MAP handover process and the Handover Control application is represented by the HO_CA_MESSAGE service. For a detailed description of the interworking between the Handover Control applications in different MSCs for the inter-MSC handover procedure, see 3GPP TS 23.009 [21].
The ordering of allocation of handover number and radio resources shown in the SDL diagrams is not mandatory.
19.2.3.1	Basic handover
The handling in MSC‑B for basic inter-MSC handover is shown in sheets 1 to 7 of figure 19.2/5.
Sheet 2: If the MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER indication included a parameter requesting multiple bearers but MSC‑B does not support multiple bearers, MSC‑B sends a MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER response indicating that multiple bearers are not supported, and waits for a possible MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER indication requesting handover of a single bearer.
Sheet 6: If the original MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER indication included a parameter indicating that handover number allocation is not required, MSC‑A may send a further MAP_PREPARE_HANDOVER request to request the allocation of a handover number (or one or more relocation numbers).
19.2.3.2	Handling of access signalling
The Handover Control application in MSC‑A may forward access signalling to any of the MS, RNS‑B or BSS‑B using the MAP_FORWARD_ACCESS_SIGNALLING service; any of the MS, RNS‑B or BSS‑B may forward access signalling to the Handover Control application in MSC‑A using the MAP_PROCESS_ACCESS_SIGNALLING service. These are non-confirmed services. Signals to or from any of the MS, RNS‑B or BSS‑B are routed through the Handover Control application in MSC‑B.
19.2.3.3	Subsequent handover
The handling in MSC‑B for subsequent inter-MSC handover is shown in sheet 8 of figure 19.2/5.
While the MAP process in MSC‑B is waiting for the completion of subsequent handover, it relays access signalling between MSC‑A and the MS, RNS‑B or BSS‑B through the Handover Control application as described in clause 19.2.3.2.
19.2.4	Macro Receive_Error_From_HO_CA
This macro is used by the handover processes in MSC‑A and MSC‑B to receive errors from the Handover Control Application at any state of a handover process.
19.2.5	Procedure in VLR‑B
The process in VLR-B to handle a request for a handover number is shown in figure 19.2/7. The process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind		see clause 25.1.1;
Check_Indication		see clause 25.2.1.

19.3	Fault recovery procedures
When a location register has restarted after a fault, the fault recovery procedures ensure that the subscriber data in the VLR or in the SGSN become consistent with the subscriber data that are stored in the HLR for the MS concerned and that the location information in the HLR , the VLR and the SGSN reflect accurately the current location of the MS.
The stage 2 specification of fault recovery procedures in location registers is 3GPP TS 23.007 [19].
19.3.1	VLR fault recovery procedures
19.3.1.1 General
Restoration of an IMSI record in a VLR can be triggered by a location registration request from the MS or by a request from the HLR for a roaming number to route a mobile terminated call to the MS. If the restoration is triggered by a location registration request from the MS, the VLR performs the location updating procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.012 [23] and clause 19.1.1 of the present document. If the restoration is triggered by a request for a roaming number, the VLR provides the roaming number and triggers an independent dialogue to restore the subscriber data as described in 3GPP TS 23.018 [97]. The message flow for data restoration triggered by a request for a roaming number is shown in figure 19.3.1/1.

The procedure in the VLR to handle a dialogue for subscriber data restoration is defined in clause 21.2.6 of the present document.
19.3.1.3	Procedure in the HLR
The MAP process in the HLR to handle a request for data restoration in the VLR is shown in figure 19.3.1/2. The MAP process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:

Figure 19.3.1/2: Process Restore_Data_HLR
19.3.2	HLR fault recovery procedures
19.3.2.1	General
For the HLR, periodic back-up of data to non-volatile memory is mandatory.
Data that have been changed after the last back-up and before the restart of the HLR cannot be recovered by reload from the non-volatile memory. Therefore, a restoration procedure is triggered for each IMSI record that has been affected by the HLR fault at the first authenticated radio contact with the MS concerned.
As an implementation option, a notification can be forwarded to the MS to alert the subscriber to check the parameters for supplementary services that allow subscriber controlled input (MAP_FORWARD_CHECK_SS_INDICATION service). If the VLR receives this notification from the HLR it shall forward the notification to the MS. If the Gs-interface is implemented the VLR shall not forward this notification.
A restoration procedure may also be triggered for IMSI records that shares subscription data with other IMSI records when the shared subscription data is modified, added or deleted. This option presumes the support of Reset-IDs.
The message flow for HLR restoration for a non-GPRS subscriber is shown in figure 19.3.2/1.

Figure 19.3.2/2: Message flow for HLR restoration (GPRS)
19.3.2.2	Procedure in the HLR
The MAP process in the HLR to notify the relevant serving nodes that the HLR has restarted is shown in figure 19.3.2/3.
The SGSN address list includes one instance of the address of each SGSN in which (according to the HLR data retrieved from the non-volatile memory) there is at least one subscriber registered who is affected by the HLR restart.
The VLR address list includes one instance of the address of each VLR in which (according to the HLR data retrieved from the non-volatile memory) there is at least one subscriber registered who is affected by the HLR restart.
The MAP process in the HLR to notify a VLR that the HLR has restarted is shown in figure 19.3.2/4. The MAP process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Cnf		see clause 25.1.2.
The MAP process in the HLR to notify an SGSN that the HLR has restarted is shown in figure 19.3.2/5. The MAP process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Cnf		see clause 25.1.2.
19.3.2.3	Procedure in the VLR
The MAP process in the VLR to handle a notification that an HLR has restarted is shown in figure 19.3.2/6. The MAP process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind		see clause 25.1.1.
When Reset-IDs are not supported or not present in the MAP_RESET indication, the VLR uses the HLR number or the HLR identity list included in the MAP_RESET indication to identify the IMSI records which are affected by the HLR restart. 
When Reset-IDs are supported and present in the MAP_RESET indication, the VLR uses the Reset-IDs included in the MAP_RESET indication to identify the affected IMSI records.
The task "Update Data" includes any required action to let the update come into effect.
If the update of shared subscription data requires only local updates in the VLR (i.e., the update of the profile does not imply to initiate any signalling interaction towards other network nodes), the updates should be performed immediately (e.g. deleting an Operator Determined Barring).
If the update of shared subscription data implies initiating a signalling interaction towards other nodes, the signalling towards other nodes should be deferred to the next authenticated radio contact with that UE.
NOTE:	The rational for the recommendation to defer signalling towards other nodes until the next authenticated radio contact is to consider impacts to the network only when the updates are required, and to spread the signalling towards other nodes over some time, based on user's activity.
To avoid high processing/signalling load resulting from shared subscription data update, processing/signalling actions resulting from data updates in the VLR may take a maximum operator configuration-depending time.

19.3.2.4	Procedure in the SGSN
The MAP process in the SGSN to handle a notification that an HLR has restarted is shown in figure 19.3.2/7. The MAP process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind		see clause 25.1.1.
When Reset-IDs are not supported or not present in the MAP_RESET indication, the SGSN uses the HLR number or the HLR identity list included in the MAP_RESET indication to identify the IMSI records which are affected by the HLR restart. 
When Reset-IDs are supported and present in the MAP_RESET indication, the SGSN uses the Reset-IDs included in the MAP_RESET indication to identify the affected IMSI records.

19.3.3.1	General
For the CSS, periodic back-up of data to non-volatile memory is mandatory.
Serving node numbers that have been changed after the last back-up and before the restart of the CSS cannot be recovered by reload from the non-volatile memory. Therefore, a restoration procedure is triggered for each IMSI record that has been affected by the CSS fault at the first authenticated radio contact with the MS concerned.

19.5	HLR Insert Subscriber Data macros
19.5.1	Macro Insert_Subs_Data_Framed_HLR
This macro is used to transfer subscriber data to the VLR as part of an existing dialogue for location updating or data restoration. The macro invokes a macro and a process not defined in this clause; the definitions of the macro and the process can be found as follows:
Wait_For_Insert_Subs_Data_Cnf	see clause 25.7.5;
Send_Insert_Subs_Data_HLR:	see clause 25.7.7.
The HLR may wait for each MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request to be acknowledged before it sends the next request, or it may handle the requests and the confirmations in parallel.
If the VLR has indicated that it does not support a service or feature (e.g. Closed User Group or Advice Of Charge Charging Level) which the HLR operator regards as essential for the subscriber, the macro Wait_for_Insert_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit; the HLR sets the Roaming Restriction Due To Unsupported Feature flag to roaming restricted and sends Roaming Restriction Due To Unsupported Feature in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.
If the HLR operator does not regard the unsupported service or feature as essential for the subscriber but the macro Wait_for_Insert_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit, the HLR sends the data for a replacement service in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.
If subscriber data for CAMEL Phase 2 or later services are sent to a VLR which does not support the appropriate phase of CAMEL, the service behaviour may be unpredictable or incorrect. The HLR should therefore ensure that at the conclusion of a stand alone Insert Subscriber data procedure the data in the VLR do not require a capability that the VLR does not have. Possible mechanisms to ensure this are described in 3GPP TS 23.078 [98]. 
The HLR should send a Forwarded-to number which is not in E.164 international format to the VLR only when the HLR has ascertained that the VLR supports CAMEL Phase 2 or later. Thus, the ISD message containing the Forwarded-to number which is not in E.164 international format shall be sent to the VLR only if the HLR previously received confirmation from the VLR at Location Update that CAMEL Phase 2 or later is supported.
19.5.2	Macro Insert_GPRS_Subs_Data_Framed_HLR
This macro is used to transfer subscriber data to the SGSN as part of an existing dialogue for location updating. The macro invokes a macro and a process not defined in this clause; the definitions of the macro and the process can be found as follows:
Wait_For_Insert_GPRS_Subs_Data_Cnf	see clause 25.7.5;
Send_Insert_Subs_Data_HLR:	see clause 25.7.7.
The HLR may wait for each MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request to be acknowledged before it sends the next request, or it may handle the requests and the confirmations in parallel.
If the SGSN has indicated that it does not support a service or feature which the HLR operator regards as essential for the subscriber, the macro Wait_for_Insert_GPRS_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit; the HLR sets the Roaming Restricted In SGSN Due To Unsupported Feature flag to roaming restricted and sends Roaming Restricted In SGSN Due To Unsupported Feature in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.
If the HLR operator does not regard the unsupported service or feature as essential for the subscriber but the macro Wait_for_Insert_GPRS_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit, the HLR sends the data for a replacement service in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.

20	Operation and maintenance procedures
20.1	General
The Operation and Maintenance procedures are used to support operation and maintenance of the network.
The following procedures exist for operation and maintenance purposes:
i)	Tracing procedures;
ii)	Subscriber Data Management procedures;
iii)	Subscriber Identity procedure.
The following application contexts refer to complex MAP Users consisting of several processes:
-	subscriberDataManagementContext;
-	tracingContext.
Each of these two application contexts needs a co-ordinating process in the VLR or in the SGSN as described in the following clauses.
20.1.1	Tracing Co-ordinator for the VLR
The Tracing Co-ordinator process in the VLR is shown the figure 20.1/1. The MAP process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind		see clause 25.1.1.
20.1.2	Tracing Co-ordinator for the SGSN
The Tracing Co-ordinator process in the SGSN is shown in figure 20.1/2. The MAP process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind		see clause 25.1.1.
20.1.3	Subscriber Data Management Co-ordinator for the VLR
The Subscriber Data Management Co-ordinator process in the VLR is shown in figure 20.1/3 and figure 20.1/5. The MAP process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:

20.2	Tracing procedures
Three types of tracing procedures exist:
i)	Subscriber tracing management procedures;
ii)	Subscriber tracing procedures;
iii)	Event tracing procedures.
The subscriber tracing management procedures are used to manage the status and the type of the tracing. The subscriber tracing activation procedure is used at location updating or data restoration when the trace mode of a subscriber is set active in the HLR or, as a stand alone procedure, when the subscriber is already registered and the trace mode becomes active in the HLR. The procedures to activate tracing in the VLR are shown in figures 20.2/1 and 20.2/3. The procedures to activate tracing in the SGSN are shown in figures 20.2/2 and 20.2/4.

20.3	Subscriber data management procedures for HLR
Two types of subscriber data management procedures exist:
1)	Subscriber Deletion;
2)	Subscriber Data Modification.
The subscriber deletion and subscriber data modification procedures are initiated by the OMC (see figures 20.3/1 , 20.3/2, 20.3/3 and 20.3/4).


1)	Delete Subscriber
2)	MAP_CANCEL_LOCATION_req/ind
3)	MAP_CANCEL_LOCATION_rsp/cnf
4)	Subscriber Deleted

Figure 20.3/1: Subscriber deletion procedure for non-GPRS

20.3.2	Subscriber data modification procedure
20.3.2.1	Procedure in the HLR
The OMC can modify the subscriber data in several different ways. The modifications can be categorised in the following groups:
1)	data shall be modified in the HLR; no effect in the VLR;
2)	data shall be modified in both the HLR and the VLR;
3)	withdrawal of a basic service or a supplementary service requiring change to VLR data;
4)	modification affects the roaming permission for the subscriber and the subscriber record shall be removed from the VLR data base;

21	Call handling procedures
21.1	General
The MAP call handling procedures are used:
-	to retrieve routeing information to handle a mobile terminating call;
-	to transfer control of a call back to the GMSC if the call is to be forwarded;
-	to retrieve and transfer information between anchor MSC and relay MSC for inter MSC group calls / broadcast calls;
-	to handle the reporting of MS status for call completion services;
-	to handle the notification of remote user free for CCBS;
-	to handle the alerting and termination of ongoing call activities for a specific subscriber;
-	to handle early release of no longer needed resources;
-	to relay a mobile terminating call from the old to the new MSC during the Mobile Terminating Roaming Forwarding procedure.
The procedures to handle a mobile originating call and a mobile terminating call after the call has arrived at the destination MSC do not require any signalling over a MAP interface. These procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 23.018 [97].
The stage 2 specification for the retrieval of routeing information to handle a mobile terminating call is in 3GPP TS 23.018 [97]; modifications to this procedure for CAMEL are specified in 3GPP TS 23.078 [98], for optimal routeing of a basic mobile-to-mobile call in 3GPP TS 23.079 [99] and for CCBS in 3GPP TS 23.093 [107]. The interworking between the MAP signalling procedures and the call handling procedures for each entity (GMSC, HLR and VLR) is shown by the transfer of signals between these procedures.
The stage 2 specification for the transfer of control of a call back to the GMSC if the call is to be forwarded is in 3GPP TS 23.079 [99]. The interworking between the MAP signalling procedures and the call handling procedures for each entity (VMSC and GMSC) is shown by the transfer of signals between these procedures.
The stage 2 specifications for inter MSC group calls / broadcast calls are in 3GPP TS 43.068 [100] and 3GPP TS 43.069 [101]. The interworking between the MAP signalling procedures and the group call /broadcast call procedures for each entity (Anchor MSC and Relay MSC) is shown by the transfer of signals between these procedures.
The interworking between the call handling procedures and signalling protocols other than MAP are shown in 3GPP TS 23.018, 3GPP TS 23.078 and 3GPP TS 23.079 [99].
The stage 2 specification for the handling of reporting of MS status for call completion services and notification of remote user free for CCBS is in 3GPP TS 23.093 [107].
The stage 2 specification for the Mobile Terminating Roaming Forwarding procedure is in 3GPP TS 23.018 [97] and 3GPP TS 23.012 [23].
21.2	Retrieval of routing information
21.2.1	General
The message flows for successful retrieval of routeing information for a mobile terminating call are shown in figure 21.2/1 (mobile terminating call which has not been optimally routed) and 21.2/2 (mobile-to-mobile call which has been optimally routed). The message flow for successful  retrieval of routeing information for a gsmSCF initiated call is shown in figure 21.2/3. The message flow for a successful  Mobile Terminating Roaming Forwarding procedure is shown in figure 21.2/4.

22.2.2	Procedure in the MSC
The A_REGISTER_SS service indication received by the MAP process in the MSC contains the SS-Code and any parameters that are related to the supplementary service.
The MAP user transfers the received information to the VLR in the MAP_REGISTER_SS request without checking the contents of the service indication. Rules for the mapping are described in 3GPP TS 29.011 [59].
The information in the MAP_REGISTER_SS confirm from the VLR is relayed to the MS in the A_REGISTER_SS response message as described in 3GPP TS 24.08x, 3GPP TS 24.08x and 3GPP TS 29.011.
For call independent SS operations, each message shall contain only a single component. Messages which contain more than one component will be stopped at the air interface (as specified in 3GPP TS 29.011 [59]).
The registration process in the MSC is shown in figure 22.2.2/1.
22.2.3	Procedure in the VLR
The MAP process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind		see clause 25.1.1;
Receive_Open_Cnf		see clause 25.1.2;
Check_Confirmation		see clause 25.2.2;
Process_Access_Request_VLR	see clause 25.4.2.
The MAP process in the VLR transfers the information received in the MAP_REGISTER_SS indication to the HLR in the MAP_REGISTER_SS request without checking the contents. The MAP_OPEN request includes the IMSI of the subscriber as the destination reference and the VLR number as the originating reference.
If the MAP_REGISTER_SS confirm is properly formed and contains a result or a user error, the MAP process in the VLR shall transfer the information contained in this primitive to the MSC in the MAP_REGISTER_SS response.
For call independent SS operations, each message shall contain only a single component. Messages which contain more than one component will be stopped at the air interface (as specified in 3GPP TS 29.011 [59]).
The registration process in the VLR is shown in figure 22.2.3/1.

22.4.2	Procedure in the MSC
The A_ACTIVATE_SS service indication received by the MAP user in the MSC contains the SS-Code and any parameters related to the supplementary service.
The MSC transfers the received information to the VLR in the MAP_ACTIVATE_SS request without checking the contents of the service indication. Rules for the mapping are described in 3GPP TS 29.011 [59].
The information in the MAP_ACTIVATE_SS confirm from the VLR is relayed to the MS in the A_ACTIVATE_SS response message, as described in TS 24.08x, 3GPP TS 24.08x and 3GPP TS 29.011.
For call independent SS operations, each message shall contain only a single component. Messages which contain more than one component will be stopped at the air interface (as specified in 3GPP TS 29.011 [59]).
The activation process in the MSC is shown in figure 22.4.2/1.

The HLR acts as follows:
The interrogation is answered either by the VLR or by the HLR, depending on the service interrogated.
1)	Interrogation to be handled by the VLR
	If the interrogation procedure should have been answered by the VLR, then the HLR assumes that the VLR does not support the interrogated supplementary service, and returns the SS Not Available error to the VLR.
2)	Interrogation to be handled by HLR
	The supplementary service request shall be processed according to 3GPP TS 23.011 [22] and the 23.08x and 23.09x-series of technical specifications. This handling may lead to either a successful result or an error being returned.
For call independent SS operations, each message shall contain only a single component. Messages which contain more than one component will be stopped at the air interface (as specified in 3GPP TS 29.011 [59]).

23	Short message service procedures
23.1	General
The short message service procedures are used to control both mobile originated and mobile terminated short message transfer.
Four procedures exist for short message services:
-	mobile originated short message service transfer;
-	mobile terminated short message service transfer;
-	short message alert procedure;
-	short message delivery status report procedure.
The following application context refers to a complex MAP user consisting of several processes:
-	shortMessageGatewayContext.
This application context needs a co-ordinating process in the HLR. Additionally a co-ordinating process needed for the mobile originated situation in the MSC, because the A_CM_SERV_REQ message does not distinguish between mobile originated short message transfer and the short message alert procedures.
NOTE:	the A_CM_SERV_REQ message is not used for SMS over GPRS. The modelling is based on the assumption that the SGSN will trigger the appropriate process, according to whether an RP_MO_DATA or an RP_SM_MEMORY_AVAILABLE is received over the LLC layer.
When the "SMS in MME" architecture option is supported, the clause 23 and its associated figures applies where HSS replaces HLR and where MME is handled as a MSC, except the procedures between  the serving MSC and the VLR which, here, are not applicable to the MME.
NOTE:	MSC and MME cannot be both registered as serving nodes for MT SMS at a given time (cf 3GPP TS 23.272 [2])
23.1.1	Mobile originated short message service Co-ordinator for the MSC
The process starts when the MSC receives an A_CM_SERV_REQ message (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [35]), with a CM service type indicating short message service, from the A-interface. The process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Process_Access_Request_MSC	see clause 25.4.1.
If the macro Process_Access_Request_MSC takes the "OK" exit (which means that the MSC has sent an A_CM_SERVICE_ACCEPT to the MS), , the MS initiates mobile originated short message transfer or sends an indication that it has memory available for more short messages. 
The SMS Co-ordinator process in the MSC is shown in figure 23.1/1.
23.1.2	Short message Gateway Co-ordinator for the HLR
The process starts when the HLR receives a MAP_OPEN indication using when the application context shortMessageGatewayContext. The MAP process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind	see clause 25.1.1.
The SM Gateway Co-ordinator process in the HLR is shown in figure 23.1/2.
If the Receive_Open_Ind macro takes the Vr exit then HLR shall perform the MAP dialogue as specified for the appropriate application context version. Depending on the subscriber data, handling at the MAP user application level may be performed as specified in clauses 23.3.2 and 23.5.2 of the present document:

23.2	The mobile originated short message transfer procedure
The mobile originated short message service procedure is used to forward a short message from a mobile subscriber to a Service Centre. The message flow for the mobile originated short message service procedure is shown in figure 23.2/1.


1)	Short Message (3GPP TS 24.011 [37]).

7)	MAP_MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK.
8)	Short Message Acknowledgement (3GPP TS 24.011 [37]).
(*)	Messages 2) and 3) are not used by the SGSN.
(**)	If
a)
	the capacity of a message signal unit in the lower layers of the protocol is enough to carry the	content of the MAP_OPEN request and the content of the	MAP_MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE request in a single TC message

and
	b)	the Interworking MSC operator and the serving node (MSC or SGSN) operator agreed	not to use the TCAP handshake countermeasure against SMS fraud for messages	exchanged between their networks (see 3GPP TS 33.204 [34a])

	then
 the TCAP handshake may be omitted.

23.2.1	Procedure in the serving MSC
Any CAMEL-specific handling defined in this clause is omitted if the MSC does not support CAMEL control of MO SMS, or if the subscriber does not have a subscription for CAMEL control of MO SMS.
The process starts when the MSC receives a short message from the MS. The process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Cnf	see clause 25.1.2;
Check_Indication	see clause 25.2.1;
Check_Confirmation	see clause 25.2.2.
Sheet 1: If the MSC is integrated with the SMS-IWMSC, it communicates directly with the Short Message Service Centre (SMSC) using one of the protocols described in 3GPP TS 23.039 [25a]; otherwise it communicates with the SMS-IWMSC using MAP.
Sheet 3: If the capacity of a message signal unit in the lower layers of the protocol is enough to carry the content of the MAP_OPEN request and the content of the MAP_MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE request in a single TC message, the test "Message segmentation needed" takes the "No" exit; otherwise the test takes the "Yes" exit.
Sheet 3:The decision box "TCAP Handshake required" takes the "yes" or "no" exit depending on agreements between the serving MSC's operator and the SMS-IWMSC's operator (see 3GPP TS 33.204 [34a]).

The process starts when the SGSN receives a short message received from the MS over the Gb interface. The MAP process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Cnf	see clause 25.1.2;
Check_Confirmation	see clause 25.2.2.
Sheet 2: If the capacity of a message signal unit in the lower layers of the protocol is enough to carry the content of the MAP_OPEN request and the content of the MAP_MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE request in a single TC message, the test "Message segmentation needed" takes the "No" exit; otherwise the test takes the "Yes" exit. 
Sheet 2:The decision box "TCAP Handshake required" takes the "yes" or "no" exit depending on agreements between the serving SGSN's operator and the SMS-IWMSC's operator (see 3GPP TS 33.204 [34a]).
The mobile originated short message service process in the SGSN is shown in figure 23.2/4.
23.2.4	Procedure in the SMS Interworking MSC (SMS-IWMSC)
This procedure applies only when the SMS-IWMSC is not integrated with the serving MSC or SGSN.
The process starts when the SMS-IWMSC receives a dialogue opening request with the application context shortMsgMO-RelayContext. The MAP process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind	see clause 25.1.1;
Check_Indication	see clause 25.2.1.
Sheet 1:The decision box "TCAP Handshake required" takes the "yes" or "no" exit depending on agreements between the SMS-IWMSC's operator and the serving node's operator (see 3GPP TS 33.204 [34a]).

23.3.1	Procedure in the SMS-GMSC
Any CAMEL-specific handling described in this clause is omitted if the SMS-GMSC does not support CAMEL. CAMEL-specific handling is invoked only if the SMS-GMSC is integrated with the VMSC.
The process starts when the SMS-GMSC receives an SC_RP_MT_DATA indication from a Service Centre. The MAP process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Cnf		see clause 25.1.2;
Check_Confirmation		see clause 25.2.2.
Process MT_SM_GMSC sheet 1: If the MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SM confirmation included an LMSI, it shall be included in the sm-RP-DA information field of the first MAP_MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE request sent to the serving MSC. In this case, the IMSI shall be included in the Destination Reference of the MAP_OPEN request. The SMS-GMSC shall not send an LMSI to an SGSN. If the SMS-GMSC does not send an LMSI to the serving node, the sm-RP-DA information field in the first MAP_MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE request sent to the serving MSC or SGSN shall contain the IMSI, and the Destination Reference in the MAP_OPEN request shall not be present. The parameter SM_RP_OA shall contain the Service Centre address.
Process MT_SM_GMSC sheet 1: The indication of which number belongs to the SGSN and which to the MSC, received from the HLR in the MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SM confirm (see clause 23.3.2) will enable the SMS-GMSC to map the causes received from one or both serving nodes into the appropriate causes for non GPRS, GPRS or both, and send them to the SC and the HLR.
Process MT_SM_GMSC sheet 2: The SMS-GMSC maps "Unexpected data value" and "System failure" MAP errors from the serving node to a "System failure" RP_ERROR error cause. The mapping between other MAP error causes and the RP_ERROR error cause is given in 3GPP TS 23.040 [26] and 3GPP TS 24.011 [37].
Process MT_SM_GMSC sheet 2: If the SMS-GMSC receives both MSC and SGSN numbers from the HLR as routeing information, it may choose which serving node to use for the first delivery attempt.
Process MT_SM_GMSC sheet 2: If the SMS-GMSC makes two delivery attempts, it may report the result of each delivery attempt to the HLR according to the conditions described below.
Procedure MT_SM_Delivery_Attempt_GMSC sheet 1: if the macro MT_SM_Transfer_MSC takes the Error exit, the SMS-GMSC maps the MAP User Error to the corresponding SC_RP error, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 [26].
Procedure MT_SM_Delivery_Attempt_GMSC sheet 3: The decision box "TCAP Handshake required" takes the "yes" or "no" exit depending on agreements between the GMSC's operator and the serving node's operator (see 3GPP TS 33.204 [34a]).
Procedure MT_SM_Delivery_Attempt_GMSC sheet 1, sheet 2, sheet 4, sheet 5: The SMS-GMSC invokes the macro Report_SM_Delivery_Stat_GMSC if:
-	the reason received from the serving node for failure to deliver the message is absent subscriber_SM, unidentified subscriber or SM delivery failure with error cause "MS memory capacity exceeded", and the SC address is not yet included in the MWD set, or
-	the reason received from the serving node for failure to deliver the message is absent subscriber_SM, unidentified subscriber or SM delivery failure with error cause MS memory capacity exceeded, and the corresponding flag in the HLR (as indicated in the information received in the MAP_INFORM_ SERVICE_CENTRE) is not set, or
-	the reason received from the serving node (MSC or SGSN) for failure to deliver the message is absent subscriber_SM and the absent subscriber diagnostic is different from the absent subscriber diagnostic received in the MAP_INFORM_ SERVICE_CENTRE.
Procedure MT_SM_Delivery_Attempt_GMSC sheet 1, sheet 2, sheet 4, sheet 5: If absent subscriber diagnostic information (see 3GPP TS 23.040 [26]) is included with the absent subscriber_SM error indication then the SMS-GMSC relays this information to the HLR using the MAP_REPORT_SM_DELIVERY_STATUS service.
Procedure MT_SM_Delivery_Attempt_GMSC sheet 1, sheet 4: The More Messages To Send flag is set to TRUE or FALSE according to the information received from the Service Centre.
Procedure MT_SM_Delivery_Attempt_GMSC sheet 3: If the capacity of a message signal unit in the lower layers of the protocol is enough to carry the content of the MAP_OPEN request and the content of the MAP_MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE request in a single TC message, the test "Message segmentation needed" takes the "No" exit; otherwise the test takes the "Yes" exit.
The mobile terminated short message transfer process in the SMS-GMSC is shown in figure 23.3/3. The procedure MT_SM_Delivery_Attempt_GMSC is shown in figure 23.3/4. The macro MT_SM_Transfer_MSC is shown in figure 23.3/7.
The SMS-GMSC may include the Maximum Retransmission Time IE in the MT Forward Short Message Request to indicate that it is capable to retransmit the Short Message until the indicated maximum retransmission time, if the following conditions are fulfilled:
-	the destination user pertains to the PLMN of the SMS-GMSC; and
-	if an SMS Router is used for MT SMS sent to destination users pertaining to the PLMN of the SMS-GMSC, the SMS Router is known to support the Alert Service Centre procedure specified in clause 12.5. 
The SMS-GMSC shall include its E.164 number in the SMS-GMSC address and, if available its Diameter Identity in the SMS-GMSC Diameter Address in the request if it also includes the Maximum-Retransmission-Time IE.  
If subsequently, the SMS-GMSC receives an Alert Service Centre request from an MME (via an IWF), SGSN or MSC, the SMS-GMSC shall retransmit pending MT SMS(s) for the destination user identified by the User Identifier Alert, to the same serving node if the SMS-GMSC Alert Event indicates that the MS is available for MT SMS, or to the new serving node if the SMS-GMSC Alert Event indicates that the MS has moved under the coverage of another MME, SGSN or MSC. In the latter case, if neither New MSC Number, nor New SGSN Number, nor New SGSN Diameter Address, nor New MME Number, nor New MME Diameter Address are received in the Alert Service Centre request, the SMS-GMSC shall initiate a Send Routing Info for SM procedure to retrieve the new serving node 's address from the HLR.
23.3.2	Procedure in the HLR
The process starts when the HLR receives a MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SM indication from the SMS-GMSC. If an SMS Router is deployed, the HLR receives MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SM from the SMS Router (step 4 in figure 23.3/2a); relaying a message received from the SMS-GMSC to the SMS Router on SCCP level (steps 2 and 3 in figure 23.3/2a) is done by implementation specific means and is not shown in figure 23.3/5.
The MAP process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Check_Indication		see clause 25.2.1.
Sheet 1: The decision box "Relay to IP-SM-GW" takes the "yes" exit if an IP-SM-GW is deployed and the message was not received from an IP-SM-GW.
Sheet 3: If the SMS-GMSC does not support GPRS functionality, it uses the protocol defined in the Release 96 version of this specification. The parameter "msc-Number" in "RoutingInfoForSM-Res" in the Release 96 version of the protocol definition corresponds to the parameter "networkNode-Number" in "RoutingInfoForSM-Res" in the Release 97 (and later) version of the protocol definition; therefore if the HLR populates the parameter "networkNode-Number" with the SGSN number, the Release 96 SMS-GMSC will interpret the SGSN number as an MSC number. If the HLR populates the "gprsNodeIndicator" parameter in the MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SM response, a Release 96 SMS-GMSC will silently discard the parameter.
Sheet 5: If the HLR received a LMSI from the VLR at location updating, it shall include the LMSI in the MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SM response only if the MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SM response also includes the MSC number.
The mobile terminated short message transfer process in the HLR is shown in figure 23.3/5.
23.3.3	Procedure in the Serving MSC
Any CAMEL-specific handling defined in this clause is omitted if the MSC does not support CAMEL control of MT SMS, or if the subscriber does not have a subscription for CAMEL control of MT SMS.
The process starts when the MSC receives a dialogue opening request with the application context shortMsgMT-RelayContext. The MAP process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind		see clause 25.1.1;
Check_Indication		see clause 25.2.1.
The mobile terminated short message transfer process in the serving MSC is shown in figure 23.3/6 
Procedure MT_SM_VMSC sheet 1: The decision box "TCAP Handshake required" takes the "yes" or "no" exit depending on agreements between the Serving MSC's operator and the SMS Gateway MSC's operator (see 3GPP TS 33.204 [34a]).
The macro MT_SM_Transfer_MSC may be invoked either in a stand-alone serving MSC or in a serving MSC which is integrated with the SMS-GMSC. It is used to transfer the first MT short message of a possible sequence of messages. The macro invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Check_Confirmation		see clause 25.2.2.
Page_MSC		see clause 25.3.1;
Search_for_MS_MSC	see clause 25.3.2;
Process_Access_Request_MSC	see clause 25.4.1;
Trace_Subscriber_Activity_MSC	see clause 25.9.1.
The macro MT_SM_Transfer_MSC is shown in figure 23.3/7. The macro Check_Subscr_Identity_For_MT_SMS is shown in figure 23.3/8. 
3GPP TS 29.118 [152] specifies the extensions applicable to the MT SMS procedure over SGs for a UE using extended idle mode DRX (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.682 [148]).
If the MS is using a power saving mechanism such as extended idle mode DRX (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [148]), and if the MT Forward Short Message Request includes the Maximum Retransmission Time IE, an MSC using Deployment Option 2 (see clause 8.2.4a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.272 [143] and 3GPP TS 23.040 [6]) may return an MT Forward Short Message Response with the User Error set to Absent Subscriber_SM and with the Requested-Retransmission-Time IE requesting the SMS-GMSC to retransmit the Short Message at a later time prior to the Maximum Retransmission Time. In that case, the MSC shall store (if not already done) the SMS-GMSC address and, if available, the SMS-GMSC Diameter Identity received in the request and shall not set the MNRF flag.  
NOTE:	This mechanism does not cause additional signalling at the HSS to retransmit the Short Message.
An MSC using Deployment Option 2 (see clause 8.2.4a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.272 [143] and 3GPP TS 23.040 [6]) shall initiate the MAP Service Center Alert procedure to alert the SMS-GMSC when the UE, for which one or more MT SMS have been requested to be retransmitted at a later time, becomes available for MT SMS delivery or moves under the coverage of another MSC prior to the requested SM retransmission time. The MSC shall then delete the stored SMS-GMSC address after the Alert Service Centre procedure is completed.

23.3.4	Procedure in the VLR
Any CAMEL-specific handling defined in this clause is omitted if the VLR does not support CAMEL control of MT SMS.
The process starts when the VLR receives a dialogue opening request from the MSC. The process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind		see clause 25.1.1;
Check_Indication		see clause 25.2.1;
Check_Confirmation		see clause 25.2.2;
Process_Access_Request_VLR	see clause 25.4.2.
The mobile terminated short message transfer process in the VLR is shown in figure 23.3/9.
If the VLR has no IMSI record, or if the record is marked "Subscriber Data Not Confirmed by HLR", the VLR may perform the data restoration procedure as specified in clause 4.2.2 in 3GPP TS 23.007 [19].
23.3.5	Procedure in the SGSN
Any CAMEL-specific handling defined in this clause is omitted if the SGSN does not support CAMEL control of MT SMS, or if the subscriber does not have a subscription for CAMEL control of MT SMS.
The process starts when the SGSN receives a dialogue opening request with the application context shortMsgMT-RelayContext. The MAP process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind		see clause 25.1.1;
Check_Indication		see clause 25.2.1.
The mobile terminated short message transfer process in the SGSN is shown in figure 23.3/10. 
Procedure MT_SM_SGSN sheet 1: The decision box "TCAP Handshake required" takes the "yes" or "no" exit depending on agreements between the Serving SGSN's operator and the SMS Gateway MSC's operator (see 3GPP TS 33.204 [34a]).
The macro MT_SM_Transfer_SGSN is used to transfer the first MT short message of a possible sequence of messages. It is shown in figure 23.3/11.
If the MS is using extended idle mode DRX (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.682 [148]) and the MS is expected to respond to paging shortly or within the time frame indicated by the SM-Delivery-Timer and SM-Delivery-Start-Time IEs, the SGSN should page the MS and attempt to deliver the short message to the MS.
If the MS is using extended idle mode DRX (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.682 [148]) and the MS is expected to not respond to paging shortly or within the time frame indicated by the SM-Delivery-Timer and SM-Delivery-Start-Time IEs, the SGSN may behave as specified in figure 23.3/11 for an MS that is not reachachable, i.e. set the MNRG flag and return an Absent Subscriber Error to the SMS-GMSC, while still paging the MS.
NOTE 1:	This mechanism is not intended for MSs which are known to wake up shortly (e.g. within the next 10 seconds) as enough time needs to elapse, between the sending of the MT Forward Short Message Response and the subsequent Ready For SM procedure towards the HLR when the MS becomes reachable, for the Report SM Delivery Status procedure to take place beforehand from the SMS-GMSC to the HLR.
If the MS is using a power saving mechanism such as extended idle mode DRX (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [148]), and if the MT Forward Short Message Request includes the Maximum Retransmission Time IE, the SGSN may return an MT Forward Short Message Response with the User Error set to Absent Subscriber_SM and with the Requested-Retransmission-Time IE requesting the SMS-GMSC to retransmit the Short Message at a later time prior to the Maximum Retransmission Time. In that case, the SGSN shall store (if not already done) the SMS-GMSC address and, if available, the SMS-GMSC Diameter Identity received in the request and shall not set the MNRG flag.  
NOTE 2:	This mechanism does not cause additional signalling at the HSS to retransmit the Short Message.
The SGSN shall initiate the MAP Service Center Alert procedure to alert the SMS-GMSC when the UE, for which one or more MT SMS have been requested to be retransmitted at a later time, becomes available for MT SMS delivery or moves under the coverage of another MME or SGSN prior to the requested SM retransmission time. The SGSN shall then delete the stored SMS-GMSC address after the Alert Service Centre procedure is completed.
The macro Check_Subscr_Identity_For_MT_SMS is shown in figure 23.3/8. The page and search procedures are shown in figures 23.3/12 and 23.3/13.
23.3.6	Procedure in the SMS Router
If SMS Router is deployed together with IP-SM-GW, then mobile terminated short message transfer process for IP-SM-GW applies as described in clause 23.3.7.
The mobile terminated short message transfer process in the SMS Router is shown in figure 23.3/14.
Procedure MT_SM_SMS_ROUTER sheet 2: Allocated MT Correlation IDs have a limited lifetime, managed by Timer T1. The value of Timer T1 shall be operator configurable (its value being dependant on such factors as subscriber base, network size, number of roaming/SMS‑interworking partners, average and peak SMS traffic load, etc.). 
The value of the timer T1 shall cover at least the time indicated by the SM Delivery Start Time and SM Delivery Timer and, if the SMS Router support the Alert Service Centre procedure specified in clause 12.5, the Maximum Retransmission Time signalled in the MAP-MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE.
Procedure MT_SM_SMS_ROUTER sheet 2: MAP parameters to be stored against the MT Correlation ID are IMSI, networkNode-Number, gprsNodeIndicator, and additional-Number (if and as received within MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SHORT_MESSAGE_cnf), and optionally MSISDN as received within MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SHORT_MESSAGE_ind from the SMS-GMSC (and relayed by the HLR)). The SMS Router may also store the GT, or just the CC and NDC parts of the GT, of the SMS-GMSC from which the MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO_FOR_SHORT_MESSAGE_ind was received.
Procedure MT_SM_SMS_ROUTER sheet 3: The SCCP called party SSN received with Open_ind is used to decide whether the new dialogue is opend with the MSC or with the SGSN.
The detail of replacing RP-OA is described in TS23.040 [26].
Procedure MT_SM_SMS_ROUTER sheet 4: The decision box "Retry expected" takes the "Yes" exit if two addresses were received from the HLR, the first delivery attempt was unsuccessful, and the second attempt has not yet been made.
Procedure MT_SM_SMS_ROUTER sheet 4: The task "Release MT Correlation ID" includes deleting of data stored against the MT Correlation ID.
If the MT Forward Short Message Request includes the Maximum-Retransmission-Time IE, the SMS Router shall store the SMS-GMSC address and, if available, the SMS-GMSC Diameter Identity received in the request and replace it by its SMS Router address (E.164 number) and, if available, its SMS Router Diameter Identity when forwarding the request to the MME (via an IFW), SGSN or MSC.
If the MT Forward Short Message Response includes the Requested-Retransmission-Time IE, the SMS Router shall include the User Identifier Alert IE when forwarding the response to the SMS-GMSC.
NOTE:	The User Identifier Alert is further used in the Alert Service Centre procedure specified in clause 12.5 to enable the SMS-GMSC to identify and retransmit all pending MT SMS messages towards the destination user.
When receiving an Alert Service Centre request from an MME (via an IWF), SGSN or MSC, the SMS-Router shall replace the IMSI received in the IMSI IE by the User Identifier Alert previously sent in the MT Forward Short Message Response, and forward that request to the SMS-GMSC.
23.3.7	Procedure in the IP-SM-GW 
Process MT_SM_IPSMGW sheet 3: After unsuccessful delivery via the S-CSCF the IP-SM-GW may retry delivery via MSC and/or SGSN if MSC address and/or SGSN address are available (unless the reported error was "memory capacity exceeded" in which case a retry shall not be done). If the retry is successful, a positive response is returned to the SMS-GMSC. If the retry is unsuccessful, an error indication is returned to the SMS-GMSC as follows:
If one of the error indications received from S-CSCF, MSC, or SGSN is AbsentsSubscriberSM or  UnidentifiedSubscriber, this error shall be returned to the SMS-GMSC.
Process MT_SM_IPSMGW sheet 3: The IP-SM-GW invokes the macro Report_SM_Delivery_Stat_IPSMGW if: 
-	the reason for failure to deliver the message is absent subscriber_SM, unidentified subscriber or SM delivery failure with error cause "MS memory capacity exceeded", and the SC address is not yet included in the MWD set, or
-	the reason for failure to deliver the message is absent subscriber_SM, unidentified subscriber or SM delivery failure with error cause MS memory capacity exceeded, and the corresponding flag in the HLR (as indicated in the information received in the MAP_INFORM_SERVICE_CENTRE) is not set, or
-	the reason for failure to deliver the message is absent subscriber_SM and the absent subscriber diagnostic is different from the absent subscriber diagnostic received in the MAP_INFORM_SERVICE_CENTRE.

The mobile terminated short message transfer process in the IP-SM-GW is shown in figure 23.3/15.

23.4	The Short Message Alert procedure
The Short Message Alert procedure is used to alert the Service Centre when the mobile subscriber is active after a short message transfer has failed because the mobile subscriber is not reachable, or when the MS has indicated that it has memory capacity to accept a short message.
The message flow for the Short Message Alert procedure for the case when the mobile subscriber was not reachable is shown in figure 23.4/1.


1)	CM Service Request (**), Page response or Location Updating (3GPP TS 24.008 [35]).
2)	MAP_PROCESS_ACCESS_REQUEST / MAP_UPDATE_LOCATION_AREA (**).
3)	MAP_READY_FOR_SM (Mobile Present) / MAP_UPDATE_LOCATION /
Supplementary Service Control Request (*).

Figure 23.4/3: Short message alert procedure (Successful transfer after polling)
23.4.1	Procedure in the Serving MSC – the MS has memory available
The process starts when the MSC receives a notification from the MS that it has memory available. The process invokes a macro not defined in this clause; the definition of this macro can be found as follows:
Check_Confirmation	see clause 25.2.2.
The short message alert process in the MSC for the MS memory capacity available case is shown in figure 23.4/4.
23.4.2	Procedures in the VLR
23.4.2.1	The Mobile Subscriber is present
If the VLR successfully handles a MAP_PROCESS_ACCESS_REQUEST indication or a MAP_UPDATE_LOCATION_AREA indication while the MS Not Reachable Flag (MNRF) is set, the VLR sends a MAP_READY_FOR_SM request to the HLR. The Alert Reason is set to indicate that the mobile subscriber is present for non GPRS. If authentication fails during the handling of a MAP_PROCESS_ACCESS_REQUEST indication or a MAP_UPDATE_LOCATION_AREA indication, the VLR shall not send a MAP_READY_FOR_SM request to the HLR. The process in the VLR is described in detail in clause 25.10.1.
23.4.2.2	The MS has memory available
The process starts when the VLR receives dialogue opening request followed by a MAP_PROCESS_ACCESS_REQUEST indication including a CM service type Short Message Service. The MAP process invokes macros not defined in this clause; the definitions of these macros can be found as follows:
Receive_Open_Ind	see clause 25.1.1;
Receive_Open_Cnf	see clause 25.1.2;
Check_Indication	see clause 25.2.1;

23.5	The SM delivery status report procedure
The SM delivery status report procedure is used:
-	to set the Service Centre address into the message waiting list in the HLR after short message delivery has failed because the subscriber is absent or unidentified or the memory capacity is exceeded. The procedure sets: 
-	the Memory Capacity Exceeded Flag (MCEF) in the HLR if the MS memory does not have room for more messages;
-	and/or the MS Not Reachable Flag for non-GPRS if there is no record for the subscriber in the VLR or the subscriber does not respond to paging for delivery via the MSC;
-	and/or the MS Not Reachable for GPRS (MNRG) flag if there is no record for the subscriber in the SGSN or the subscriber does not respond to paging for delivery via the SGSN; 
-	and/or the UE Not Reachable for IP (UNRI) flag if delivery via the IMS was not successful.
-	to report to the HLRthat delivery has succeeded. The conditions for report of a successful delivery are described in clause 23.3.1.
The message flow for the SM delivery status report procedure is shown in figure 23.5/1.


1)	MAP_MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK/_NACK (Absent subscriber_SM,
unidentified subscriber or memory capacity exceeded).
2)	MAP_REPORT_SM_DELIVERY_STATUS. (The HLR ignores the content of this message when an IP-SM-GW is deployed)
2a)	MAP_REPORT_SM_DELIVERY_STATUS (sent only by IP-SM-GW)
2b)	MAP-REPORT_SM_DELIVERY_STATUS_ACK.
3)	MAP_REPORT_SM_DELIVERY_STATUS_ACK.
4)	Short Message Negative Acknowledgement (3GPP TS 23.040).

Check_Indication	see clause 25.2.1;
Alert_Service_Centre_HLR	see clause 25.10.3.
Sheet 1: If the MAP_REPORT_SM_DELIVERY_STATUS indication did not include the GPRS support indicator, the HLR deduces the domain for which the delivery report applies as follows:
-	if the subscriber is a GPRS-only subscriber, the report applies for GPRS;
-	if the subscriber is a non-GPRS-only subscriber, the report applies for non-GPRS;
-	if the subscriber is a GPRS and non-GPRS subscriber and the subscription option for MT SMS delivery when the SMS-GMSC does not support GPRS is set to "Delivery via the SGSN", the report applies for GPRS;
-	if the subscriber is a GPRS and non-GPRS subscriber and the subscription option for MT SMS delivery when the SMS-GMSC does not support GPRS is set to "Delivery via the MSC", the report applies for non-GPRS;
The short message delivery status report macro in the HLR is shown in figure 23.6/1.

This macro checks that an indication includes all the parameters required by the application, no more and no less, and that the parameters are all within the correct range. It does not handle syntax checking; that is part of the function of the MAP protocol machine.
25.2.2	Macro Check_Confirmation
This macro checks whether a confirmation contains an error or a result, and if it contains a result whether the result is correctly formed.

25.3	The page and search macros
25.3.1	Macro PAGE_MSC
This macro is called if an unstructured SS notification, a network-initiated unstructured SS request or a mobile terminating short message is to be delivered to the MS and the current location area identity of the MS is known in the VLR.
If an MM-connection over the radio link already exists for the given IMSI, the MSC sets the access connection status according to the characteristics of the existing connection (i.e. RR-connection established, ciphering mode on/off, MM-connection existing and authenticated or not).
If the MSC pages the MS and the VLR provided the TMSI, the MSC uses it to identify the MS at the radio interface; otherwise the MSC uses the IMSI. The MSC also uses the IMSI to determine the page group (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [35]).
If the MS responds with a channel request containing an establishment cause which is not "answer to paging" the MSC sends a MAP_PAGE response primitive with user error Busy Subscriber. This gives priority to the mobile originating request. Alternatively, as an implementation option, the MSC may treat this as a response to paging, which gives priority to the mobile terminating request.
If the paging is for MT SMS delivery and the VLR aborts the transaction before the MSC receives a response from the MS, the MSC aborts the transaction with the SMS-GMSC.
25.3.2	Macro Search_For_MS_MSC
This macro is called if an unstructured SS notification, a network-initiated unstructured SS request or a mobile terminating short message is to be delivered to the MS and the current location area identity of the MS is not known in VLR.
If an MM-connection over the radio link already exists for the given IMSI, the MSC returns a MAP_SEARCH_FOR_MS response containing the IMSI and current location area identification of the called MS to the VLR and sets the access connection status according to the characteristics of the existing connection (i.e. RR-connection established, ciphering mode on/off, MM-connection existing and authenticated or not).
If the MSC pages the MS, the MSC uses the IMSI to identify the subscriber and the page group (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [35]). 
If the MS responds with a channel request containing an establishment cause which is not "answer to paging" the MSC sends a MAP_SEARCH_FOR_MS response with user error Busy Subscriber. This gives priority to the mobile originating request. Alternatively, as an implementation option, the MSC may treat this as a response to paging, which gives priority to the mobile terminating request.
If the paging is for MT SMS delivery and the VLR aborts the transaction before the MSC receives a response from the MS, the MSC aborts the transaction with the SMS-GMSC.

Figure 25.3/2: Macro Search_for_MS_MSC
25.4	Macros for handling an Access Request
These macros are invoked when a MS accesses the network, e.g. to submit an MO short message or when responding to paging. The macros handle identification and authentication of the mobile subscriber as well as invocation of security related features (see 3GPP TS 42.009 [6]).
25.4.1	Macro Process_Access_Request_MSC
Sheet 1: The MAP_PROCESS_ACCESS_REQUEST request includes the following parameters: 
-	the received subscriber identification (IMSI, TMSI);
-	the CM service type, indicating the type of request;
-	the status of the access connection, i.e. whether a connection to this MS already exists and if so, whether it is already authenticated and ciphered;
-	the current location area id of the MS; and
-	the CKSN received from the MS.
Sheet 2, sheet 3: If the MSC receives an A_SETUP indication while it is waiting for further instructions from the VLR or for the acknowledgment of TMSI reallocation from the MS, the MSC saves the setup request for processing after control has returned from the macro Process_Access_Request_MSC to the calling process.
Sheet 3: When the MSC is waiting for a possible instruction to allocate a new TMSI, a MAP_DELIMITER indication indicates that TMSI reallocation is not required.
Sheet 3: If the MS sends a TMSI reallocation failure in response to the TMSI reallocation command, the MSC takes the OK exit; the VLR treats the lack of response as a provider error (see macro Process_Access_Request_VLR).
25.4.2	Macro Process_Access_Request_VLR
Sheet 3: If the MSC does not send a positive response to the MAP_FORWARD_NEW_TMSI request, this is treated as a MAP_FORWARD_NEW_TMSI confirmation containing a provider error. The Macro takes the Error exit. If TMSI reallocation does not succeed, the old TMSI is frozen, to prevent it from being reallocated. In this case, both old and new TMSIs are regarded as valid.
25.4.3	Macro Obtain_Identity_VLR
This macro is invoked by the macro Process_Access_Request_VLR if the subscriber's identity is not known in the VLR.
It is an operator option to allow or prevent retrieval of the IMSI without encryption.
25.4.4	Process Update_Location_Child_VLR
This process is started when the subscriber successfully accesses the network, e.g. for mobile originated short message submission, response to paging or supplementary services handling. 
The procedure Notify_gsmSCF is specified in 3GPP TS 23.078.

25.5	Authentication macros and processes
The following macros are used in the network in order to enable authentication of a mobile subscriber.
25.5.1	Macro Authenticate_MSC
This macro is used by the MSC to relay a request for authentication transparently from the VLR to the MS, wait for a response from the MS and relay the response from the MS back to the VLR. 
25.5.2	Macro Authenticate_VLR
This macro is used by the VLR to control the authentication of a subscriber.
Sheet 1: The test "Received SRES=Expected SRES" indicates:
-	a comparison of the Signed RESult received from the MS with the Signed RESult received from the HLR, if GSM authentication is used (see 3GPP TS 43.020 [24]), or
-	a comparison of the RESult received from the MS with the expected RESult received from the HLR, if UMTS authentication is used (see 3GPP TS 33.102).
25.5.3	Macro Obtain_Authent_Params_VLR
This macro is used by the VLR to request authentication vectors from the HLR.
Sheet 1, sheet 2, sheet 3: It is an operator option whether to allow the re-use of old authentication triplets.
Sheet 2, sheet 3: Old UMTS quintuplets shall not be re-used.
Sheet 2: if the VLR requests more authentication vectors in the same dialogue, the subsequent MAP_SEND_AUTHENTIFICATION_INFO request has no parameters.
25.5.4	Process Obtain_Authentication_Sets_VLR
This process is initiated by the VLR to fetch authentication vectors from a subscriber's HLR independently of any other processing. 
25.5.5	Process Obtain_Authent_Sets_SGSN
The procedure for authentication when the serving node is an SGSN is described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [104] and 3GPP TS 24.008 [35].
This Process is used by the SGSN to request authentication vectors from the HLR.
Sheet 1, sheet 2: It is an operator option whether to allow the re-use of old authentication triplets.
Sheet 2: Old UMTS quintuplets shall not be re-used.
25.5.6	Process Obtain_Authent_Sets_HLR
This process is used to provide authentication vectors (triplets or quintuplets) in response to a request from a VLR or an SGSN. 
Upon receipt of an authentication information request for a UMTS subscriber, the HLR shall return authentication quintuplets. If the user is a GSM subscriber, the HLR shall return authentication triplets.
25.5.7	Authentication Failure Reporting
25.5.7.1	General
The Authentication Failure Report procedure is used to notify an HLR about the occurrence of an authentication failure in the SGSN or VLR.
The message flows for this procedure are shown in figures 25.5/7& 25.5/8.

25.6	IMEI Handling Macros
The following macros are used in the network in order to enable handling and checking of the mobile equipment identity.
25.6.1	Macro Check_IMEI_MSC
This macro is used by the MSC to receive a request from the VLR, relay it to the EIR, and pass the result from the EIR back to the VLR.
Sheet 1: If the dialogue with the EIR drops back to a previous protocol version and the EIR returned an error, the MSC relays the error to the VLR in the MAP_CHECK_IMEI response. If the dialogue with the EIR failed, or the EIR returned a badly formed result, the MSC sends a System Failure error to the VLR in the MAP_CHECK_IMEI response.
25.6.2	Macro Check_IMEI_VLR
This macro is used by the VLR to control the check of a mobile equipment's IMEI. It may also be used to request the BMUEF from the EIR.
25.6.3	Process Check_IMEI_SGSN
This process is used by the SGSN to control the check of a mobile equipment's IMEI. It may also be used to request the BMUEF from the EIR.
25.6.4	Process Check_IMEI_EIR
This process is used by the EIR to obtain the status of a mobile equipment, upon request from the MSC or from the SGSN. It may also be used to obtain the BMUEF.
25.6.5	Macro Obtain_IMEI_MSC
This macro is used by the MSC to respond to a request from the VLR to provide the IMEI. 
25.6.6	Macro Obtain_IMEI_VLR
This macro is used by the VLR to obtain the IMEI from the MSC.

25.7	Insert Subscriber Data macros and processes
25.7.1	Macro Insert_Subs_Data_VLR
This macro is used by any procedure in the VLR that triggers the reception of subscriber data (e.g. Update Location, Update VCSG Location or Restore Data).
25.7.2	Macro Insert_Subs_Data_SGSN
This macro is used by any procedure that triggers the reception of subscriber data (e.g. Update GPRS Location or Update VCSG Location ).
25.7.3	Process Insert_Subs_Data_Stand_Alone_HLR
This process is used by HLR to transfer subscriber data to the VLR in a stand alone mode, i.e. in a separate dialogue. This is done whenever a change of subscriber data is performed either by the operator or by the subscriber and this change has to be reported to the VLR.
Sheet 1: The HLR may wait for each MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request to be acknowledged before it sends the next request, or it may handle the requests and the confirmations in parallel.
Sheet 1, sheet 2: If the VLR has indicated that it does not support a service or feature (e.g. Closed User Group or Advice Of Charge Charging Level) which the HLR operator regards as essential for the subscriber, the macro Wait_for_Insert_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit; the HLR sets the Roaming Restriction Due To Unsupported Feature flag to roaming restricted and sends Roaming Restriction Due To Unsupported Feature in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.
Sheet 1, sheet 2: If the HLR operator does not regard the unsupported service or feature as essential for the subscriber but the macro Wait_for_Insert_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit, the HLR sends the data for a replacement service in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.
Sheet 2: It is an operator option whether to repeat the download of subscriber data if the VLR returns an error response. The number of repeat attempts and the interval between them is also an operator option, depending on the error response from the VLR.
If subscriber data for CAMEL Phase 2 or later services are sent to a VLR which does not support the appropriate phase of CAMEL, the service behaviour may be unpredictable or incorrect. The HLR should therefore ensure that at the conclusion of a stand alone Insert Subscriber data procedure the data in the VLR do not require a capability that the VLR does not have. Possible mechanisms to ensure this are described in 3GPP TS 23.078 [98]. 
The HLR should send a Forwarded-to number which is not in E.164 international format to the VLR only when the HLR has ascertained that the VLR supports CAMEL Phase 2 or later. Thus, the ISD message containing the Forwarded-to number which is not in E.164 international format shall be sent to the VLR only if the HLR previously received confirmation from the VLR at Location Update that CAMEL Phase 2 or later is supported.
25.7.4	Process Insert_GPRS_Subs_Data_Stand_Alone_HLR
This process is used by the HLR to transfer subscriber data from the HLR to the SGSN in a stand alone mode, i.e. in a separate dialogue. This is done whenever a change of subscriber data is performed either by the operator or by the subscriber and this change has to be reported to the SGSN.
Sheet 1: The HLR may wait for each MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request to be acknowledged before it sends the next request, or it may handle the requests and the confirmations in parallel.
Sheet 1, sheet 2: If the SGSN has indicated that it does not support a service or feature which the HLR operator regards as essential for the subscriber, the macro Wait_for_Insert_GPRS_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit; the HLR sets the Roaming Restricted In SGSN Due To Unsupported Feature flag to roaming restricted and sends Roaming Restricted In SGSN Due To Unsupported Feature in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.
Sheet 1, sheet 2: If the HLR operator does not regard the unsupported service or feature as essential for the subscriber but the macro Wait_for_Insert_GPRS_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit, the HLR sends the data for a replacement service in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.
Sheet 2: It is an operator option whether to repeat the download of subscriber data if the SGSN returns an error response. The number of repeat attempts and the interval between them is also an operator option, depending on the error response from the SGSN.
25.7.5	Macro Wait_for_Insert_Subs_Data_Cnf
This macro is used by any process or macro that describes the handling in the HLR of the transfer of subscriber data to the VLR (e.g. Update Location or Restore Data).
25.7.6	Macro Wait_for_Insert_GPRS_Subs_Data_Cnf
This macro is used by any process or macro that describes the handling in the HLR of the transfer of subscriber data to the SGSN (e.g. Update GPRS Location).
25.7.7	Process Send_Insert_Subs_Data_HLR
This process is used by any process or macro in the HLR where a MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request is sent to the VLR or to the SGSN.
25.7.8	Process Insert_VCSG_Subs_Data_Stand_Alone_CSS
This process is used by the CSS to transfer CSG subscriber data from the CSS to the VLR or the SGSN in a stand alone mode, i.e. in a separate dialogue. This is done whenever a change of CSG subscriber data in the CSS is performed either by the operator or by the subscriber and this change has to be reported to the VLR or the SGSN.
Sheet 1: The CSS may wait for each MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request to be acknowledged before it sends the next request, or it may handle the requests and the confirmations in parallel.
Sheet 1, sheet 2: If the VLR or the SGSN has indicated that it does not support a service or feature which the CSS operator regards as essential for the subscriber, the macro Wait_for_Insert_VCSG_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit.
Sheet 1, sheet 2: If the CSS operator does not regard the unsupported service or feature as essential for the subscriber but the macro Wait_for_Insert_VCSG_Subs_Data_Cnf takes the Replace_Service exit, the CSS sends the data for a replacement service in a subsequent MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request.
Sheet 2: It is an operator option whether to repeat the download of CSG subscriber data if the VLR or theSGSN returns an error response. The number of repeat attempts and the interval between them is also an operator option, depending on the error response from the VLR or the SGSN.
25.7.9	Macro Wait_for_Insert_VCSG_Subs_Data_Cnf
This macro is used by any process or macro that describes the handling in the CSS of the transfer of CSG subscriber data to the VLR or to the SGSN (e.g. Update VCSG Location).
25.7.10	Process Send_Insert_VCSG_Subs_Data_CSS
This process is used by any process or macro in the CSS where a MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA request is sent to the VLR or to the SGSN.

Annex B (informative):	Void
Annex C (informative):	
Message Segmentation Mechanisms
Various segmentation mechanisms are in use to overcome the problem where a MAP parameter carried in an Invoke, Result (or Error) component is too long to fit into a single SCCP UDT message. These mechanisms are:
C.1	SCCP segmentation
Instead of one UDT message several XUDT messages are used according to 
	Signalling Connection Control Part, Signalling System no. 7 ITU-T recommendation (07/96) Q.711 to Q.716 ('White Book SCCP').
This mechanism may be used for all MAP messages. If no segmentation mechanism at the TCAP or MAP level is available, this is the only remaining possibility.
This mechanism has no impact on the MAP provider level and above; the MAP provider sees the parameter as being sent in a single segment.
It should be noted that not all SCCP transit nodes (world wide) currently support the transfer of XUDT messages. Therefore XUDT messages may be lost without notice, depending on the route the message takes. The routes which successive messages take between two end points can differ because of load balancing. It is therefore recommended that this mechanism is used only for:
a)	messages which do not cross PLMN boundaries (when the PLMN operator ensures that all SCCP transit nodes within his PLMN support White Book SCCP)
b)	messages with low priority i.e. loss of the message does not result in serious misoperation.
It should be noted that the decision whether or not a message crosses PLMN boundaries needs to be taken at the MAP application level; it is therefore based on the message's operation code rather than on the SCCP called party address, i.e. only messages which never cross PLMN boundaries due to the type of message (SendIdentification, SendRoutingInfo without OR, AnyTimeInterrogation, ...) can be regarded as not crossing PLMN boundaries.
C.2	TCAP segmentation
At the TCAP level the following segmentation mechanisms are available:
C.2.1	Empty Begin
In a dialogue with AC version >1 the first forward message (Begin) must contain a Dialogue Portion. Instead of sending the Dialogue Portion and the Component Portion in the first forward message, an empty Begin (i.e. without a Component Portion) is sent, followed (after successful dialogue establishment) by a Continue message which can carry a longer Component Portion since no Dialogue Portion is present in the second forward message. 
C.2.2	Empty Continue
In a dialogue with AC version >1 the first backward message (Continue / End) must contain a Dialogue Portion. Instead of sending the Dialogue Portion and the Component Portion in the first backward message, an empty Continue (i.e. without a Component Portion) is sent, followed by a Continue/End message which can carry a longer Component Portion since no Dialogue Portion is present in the second backward message. 
C.2.3	TC-Result-NL
A Result component may be segmented into one or several Result-Not-Last components followed by a Result-Last component. As specified in clause 15.6.3, the MAP user parameter shall be split so that each segment is compatible with the type defined for the parameter of the result of the associated operation.
Note that this segmentation mechanism runs the risk that the message carrying the Result-Last component arrives before the message carrying a Result-Not-Last component which results in failure. The use of SCCP class 1 "Sequence guaranteed", which raises the chance of in sequence delivery, is recommended.
C.3	MAP Segmentation
At the MAP level the following segmentation mechanisms are available:
C.3.1	Invoke without explicit indication
An Invoke component may be segmented into several Invoke components. These may be sent in burst mode (in which case SCCP class 1 is recommended) or in acknowledged mode. The receiving node does not get an indication of whether or not more segments will be received, so it must not close the dialogue. The MAP user parameter shall be split so that each segment is compatible with the type defined for the parameter of the invoke of the associated operation.
C.3.2	Invoke with explicit indication
An Invoke component may be segmented into several Invoke components sent in acknowledged mode. Each component contains at the MAP level an indication of whether or not subsequent components will follow. The receiving node terminates the dialogue when the last component is received. The MAP user parameter shall be split so that each segment is compatible with the type defined for the parameter of the invoke of the associated operation.
C.3.3	Result
A Result (last) component may be segmented into several Result (last) components sent in acknowledged mode where a new (empty) Invoke component serves as an acknowledgment. The last segment is not acknowledged. The MAP user parameter shall be split so that each segment is compatible with the type defined for the parameter of the result of the associated operation.
The following tables show the applicability of the mechanisms described above:

In the tables above the keywords "recommended", "allowed", "risky", "not recommended", "not allowed" and "n.a." are used as follows:
"recommended"
indicates that the normative part of this specification explicitly specifies the use of this mechanism for the parameter in question;
"allowed"
indicates that the normative part of this specification allows the use of this mechanism for the sending node and mandates support of this mechanism for the receiving node;
"risky"
indicates that the mechanism is "allowed".However, the use of this mechanism for the parameter in question may result in serious misoperation because SCCP transit nodes are not guaranteed to support XUDT messages.
"not recommended"
indicates that the normative part of this specification does not explicitly specify the use of this mechanism for the parameter in question.
"not allowed"
indicates that the normative part of this specification implicitly prohibits the use of this mechanism for the parameter in question.
"n.a."
indicates that the mechanism is not applicable for the parameter in question.
